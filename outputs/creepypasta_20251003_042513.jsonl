Pasta of the Month Template:Adminpick/October 2025 Staff Pick To Be Summoned by DistantAngel Many rituals and games summon a specific entity that seems to exist as part of the process itself. But have you considered that sometimes when you call upon a 'guest' or a 'player', they are a simple denizen of some other world filling a role? And have you considered that some day denizens like them could call on you? Have you noticed how a ritually summoned being must invariably follow rules? That you are always in some kind of peril if you fail to observe the rules yourself? One thing you will not see is the possibility of harm befalling your visitor. Often, the visitor must even be given a gift. Now imagine that you ARE that visitor. Much safer than summoning one, right? Read on. It will come as no surprise that summoning requires a connection between worlds. The purpose of a ritual is to make that connection. If you are a little detached from the world, you may be the one to receive that connection. Have you ever been worn out and just about ready to fall asleep on your feet? So tired that you are grateful for a few seconds to close your eyes and take a deep breath? You may have noticed when you opened your eyes again that the room somehow... popped. Read more...

That happened to me, except...it didn't work. When I first saw her, I predicted that we would be friends. And we were, although, I never knew that she actually had feelings for me. A couple of months passed, and something happened...I couldn't stop thinking about her. One of my close friends, I'll call him L, kept telling me things she was saying when I wasn't around. I was intrigued. And then, in love... The week of nervousness and anxiety kicked in, and I kept telling myself \"Today, I'll ask\" but I kept putting it off until Friday...well, not exactly putting it off, we had rehearsals every day for GCSE Drama, so we were both quite busy. On that Friday, I finally got round to asking her...she told me that she used to have feelings for me, but had moved on...she still wanted to be friends, really good friends, of course. Then...I broke...I thought about her in my every waking moment, and in my sleep. I'd sometimes even shed a tear over the lost opportunity, that still seemed wide open. Our love was broken. We loved at different times. Every day and night I tried to calm myself with music. Mostly the ones that cheered me up when my best friend hated me. But that was different. Every day, I'd get home from school, I would see her online on Facebook...but the demon tells me not to speak to her. My room would start to melt whenever I heard her name, or spoke of her with an even closer friend, whom I will refer to as G. My relatives of old would speak to me from Heaven, telling me to move on, and to be stronger. But how could I be strong, when I am talking to dead relatives? I had an appointment with the Master of Insanity in my nightmare, and he said that I was very far from sane. I still loved her. I wanted to be with her until death. But her and all the others are long gone, far from my reach. I sat in my bedroom. The day outside was grey, and there was a thick layer of dust everywhere. I hadn't been at school for a long time, and neither had they. I don't remember most of them. I don't remember how old I am, or the name of the village I live in. My name means nothing... I hadn't heard from G in about 3 years. The house...if you could still call it a house, was desolate. Except a table. A table, and a pill...not the others I was taking, which I ran out of over 2 years ago. One single cyanide pill. I took it. My heart stopped, my vision blurred for what seemed like forever... I woke in my bed. Everything was how it was before I asked. I went downstairs, and saw them. My grandparents. The ones I had wanted to meet the most. And...I couldn't believe my eyes...I saw...her. As beautiful as she was the day I asked. She told me that all of my friends died in some kind of car wreck. They were all there. L, G, everyone. Even my sister and parents. I realized at last... I was home. And free... Lights went out. The room around me was nothingness. Something was wrong. Only the bones remained of the ones I love. I love nobody. That girl means nothing to me now. All anyone would do to me was neglect me. Shout at me. Hurt me, sometimes. In every way. Until I just snapped. All I ever wanted was love. The rats scurrying around in the pools of mine and others blood were good company. Also made for a half decent meal, if I was really hungry. Then one day, it was all screaming, screaming, SCREAMING, SCREAMING! All of them were supposed to stay how I'd left them. Dead. But I quickly found out you could not kill what was already deceased, and when they came for me...banging on the door, a cacophony of moans and shouts, and cries of anguish. Enough! I tried everything to get away. Cyanide. Slitting my wrists, hanging myself. I had tried in every way to kill myself, but all I could feel was immense pain of the death, only to wake up where I started. Alive. So sadly, alive. Nothing can live without a brain. Not even me. I picked up my old rusty knife, and stabbed it into my right eye, and dug deep, until a huge gaping hole was on one side. It was as if I was watching myself do it. I could see my hand reaching up to the hole in my face, I could see my overgrown fingernails clawing away at tissue. Until at last, I reached my brain. My fucked up mind. There was not brain. With my remaining eye, I looked into a broken mirror. Fog. A pale blue fog filled my head. No wonder it was so easy to get through, I saw no skull... The pale blue fog seeped out of the hole in my face, and engulfed the room. I blacked out. When I awoke, it was as if nothing had ever happened. Except...the wound stayed. not the whole wound, but it was as if the chunk of my face I'd ripped out, was simply sewn back to my head. With full vision intact, I walked over to my broken mirror, to see that my face was better, apart from a line of stitches. I woke up the next day, covered in scars. Could have been anything, rats, clawing myself in my sleep, anything. I could feel something leaking from my eyes. Not tears. Not blood. But, the pale blue fog that was in my head. Coming out of my eyes, and settling in front of me. It formed some kind of puddle. Then, formed something I hadn't seen in a long time. A person. Whether I was hallucinating or not, I didn't care. It was someone else to kill. But I didn't want to kill it. I wanted it to help me. It stepped over to me, and put a hand on my shoulder. It spoke. All this started, because one person put you down. 'That's not true. It was everyone. All my \"friends\" left me. My family knew nothing about me. Acting happy was hard.' That was no reason to live like this. Your old house. You haven't changed clothes in god knows how long. You try to kill any living thing you see. I can stop that. 'Can you kill me?' Yes, but I won't do that. I can send you back, though. Before everything, and then you'll know not to do it. Let me do this? 'Do it.' I blacked out, and woke up in my home, my real home. I looked at the date...2013. The year I asked. My mother came in shouting at me to get up, or I'll be late for school. I arrived at school. I don't remember anything about it, or who my friends are. I do remember her. There was a crowd gathered in a circle, teachers trying to calm everyone. I tried to catch a glimpse of what it was and...it was her. Impaled on a javelin. I ran. I ran out to the field, ran to the caretakers shed and cried. The pale blue fog came towards me. I saved you. Why are you crying? 'She was...my friend. You killed her...' So very pathetic. I might as well do the same to you. But I won't. I'll let you live with this, knowing it's your fault. And, no...you still can't die...sweet dreams. And I was left alone. Crying. Crying. Crying..."}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/%22Scarecrow%22_by_R_Scabree:_Reviewed_as_I_Read", "title": "Untitled", "author": "mistake. It was one of the last ones on the shelf", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Books", "WriterJosh", "Beings", "3 more", "Mental Illness", "Photography", "Computers and Internet"], "content": "I have been in the mood to read something that truly scares me. That's pretty rare. I'm not a person who scares easily. It's possible that some modern writers are told to dial it back when they write scary books, because who knows, a kid could be reading them. I dunno. But I do know that I have been feeling the lack of genuine scares lately, so I went to my local used bookstore and browsed the shelves in their horror section. I like used bookstores because they usually have much larger horror sections than a chain store might, and they definitely have a lot of older stuff there, stuff you will never see on bookshelves in modern bookstores anywhere ever again. I happened upon this book almost by mistake. It was one of the last ones on the shelf, and it was shoved behind some others, almost like the store wanted to hide it. One look at it and I knew it was old, quite possibly a first edition. The book was clearly first published long ago, and this one had been well-loved. Its pages were yellowed, dog-eared all over the place. The cover was peeling up and near to falling off. Actually, the cover was what caused me to pick it up. There was a precious little description on it. Other than its title and the author's name, the front contained no information, and on the back cover, there was simply a Yeats quote. That poem always gives me the shivers, and I was impressed by the decision to put it on the back. The first page had an excerpt, and it seemed to be about a farmer and his haunted scarecrow. That... really didn't sound too horrifying, but if the cover made me pick it up, the quote is what made me take it to the cashier. At worst, I would have wasted five bucks. At best, I might have a genuine undiscovered classic on my hands. The cover of the book made it feel both ancient and timeless. It was very simplistic, but it evoked something in me; some primal feeling that I found impossible to ignore. I might be making too much out of it, but I got a sense of foreboding looking at that cover. Modern novels tend to go all out, and create an image of a monster that might be found in a special-FX-laden big-budget horror schlock-fest designed to do little more than get teenaged asses in seats. This cover was far more minimalist, but conveyed more of a sense of unease in me than a million killer scarecrow movies ever could. So, I picked it up and brought it home. I'm only a few pages in, but already starting to feel like I've made a mistake. I've never heard of R. Scabree before, but from the first few pages, he doesn't strike me as much of a writer. He goes pretty light on the scares and when he does try and scare you, he uses a torrent of cliches that I doubt would scare a five-year-old. I'm being a little more forgiving, though, because the book isn't very long, and it's not unlikely that these cliches weren't cliches at all when Scabree was writing them. Hell, he might have invented some of them. The story, believe it or not, spends surprisingly little time out on the farm, or anywhere near the titular scarecrow. It's actually strangely political; mostly about this fifty-ish farmer named Fenton McCall and his tireless efforts to throw the local Farmer's Union rep out of his town, because he doesn't feel that they'll be fair to the workers. At least, that's mainly what it's about in the first three chapters. The only time the scarecrow itself makes an appearance is at the end of chapter one, wherein McCall has just finished setting it up, and thinks to himself that it's a \"mighty fine scarecrow\". That's literally all the scarecrow action we've gotten thus far. There was one scene that was slightly unsettling, wherein McCall, who has been depicted as a stern but loving husband, snaps at his wife and calls her a \"nosy bitch\" when she asks about the assembly meeting he's just come home from. Just that one part, that's all that's gotten under my skin, and even then it was less about the out-of-character behavior and more just a sense that scene gave me that not all is well. UPDATE: As it turns out, I was right about the scene being meant as unsettling. It's becoming clear as I read that Fenton McCall is slowly losing his mind. That's kinda more like a horror story, but still not particularly frightening. What does it have to do with the scarecrow, you ask? Well, as McCall's madness grows, he begins to imagine the scarecrow talking to him and following him as he does his work on the farm. It whispers horrific ideas, or at least, ideas that Scabree clearly hopes you'll find horrific, in his mind about murdering his nagging wife, and burning down the town assembly hall at the next meeting. However, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for. The book is illustrated. I'm not kidding. I don't know how I missed that when I flipped through the book at the store, but there it is. The art is something special, not at all in tune with the rather boring book. I flipped to the incredibly sparse credits page and could not find mention of an artist, except the one for the cover image, and he clearly isn't the guy who made the illustrations on the inside. His style is very vivid even if it's also simplistic. His drawings look almost like photographs, except blurry, or with eyes shown as glowing holes. I've scanned in the first image, which I trust you will agree is rather... strange looking. That's literally supposed to be McCall and his wife. Yeah, I don't get it either. There's nothing scary about this scene in the book. They're just walking home from church and discussing the union leader. But this is how our illustrator chooses to convey that scene. If the book itself were one-tenth as frightening as that picture, I'd probably give it a much more favorable review than I have so far. I know that some of you might think the image is cheesy-looking. Okay, I'll grant you that even looking at it here on my computer, it looks way less intense. But there's something about looking at it from the page itself that I can't even begin to describe. A feeling like they're... looking at me, somehow. Maybe I just stayed up too late reading. UPDATE: Taking a break from reading this damned book today. It's starting to get to me. Not Scabree's writing; it still sucks, but just the... I can't really explain it. There's more pictures in the book than I realized. I'm not going to upload any more of them for now because I'm having a hard time bringing myself to look at them. It's not so much what's in them as what feels like is there behind them. Whatever it is, I don't like it. I'll say this; the story has taken a strange turn. It's still barely talked about, but Scabree at one point has the scarecrow while talking to McCall, make mention of \"they,\" as if he has someone he's reporting to behind the scenes. I don't want to dig out that passage right now because when I read it, it gave me a chill. There was a picture on the next page and somehow, I knew that \"they\", whoever they are, were in the picture. The picture only showed two young girls, but I could sense \"them\" in the picture, just the same. That's enough of that. I sound paranoid, or something. It's really not as bad as I'm making it sound. Not really. I decided to google \"R. Scabree\" today. See if there's anything else he's written. Literally only three hits came up. I'm pretty sure I would get more hits if I googled my own name. The first hit was a used book site that had once been selling Scarecrow, but it was out of stock and the site looked like it hadn't been updated in years. The second hit was a dead link, which was too bad because it looked like it might contain the most actual info about this book. Maybe it would even tell me who did the artwork within the book. The final hit was a pure black page, and the \"wait\" circle kept spinning in the center as if it was loading a video or something. I waited for nearly ten minutes and while no video loaded, I could swear I heard whispers coming out of my speakers. They were low, and I never could make out what they were saying, but I could hear them, even as the circle kept spinning. Now, here's where things get weird. I went back to the search page later on because I was gonna try and let that page sit there as long as it took to load, but the hit wasn't there anymore. The first two useless links still were, but not the last one, which was the only one that I seemed to get any kind of result from, even one so unsatisfactory as a blank page attempting to load a video. So instead I googled the name of the publishing house that printed the book, Margrave Press. I got tons of hits, but when I put the name in quotes, only two pages of hits loaded, and only one hit seemed to have anything to do with a publishing company. It makes a brief mention of a guy named Tom Harky, who worked as a copy editor at Margrave Press for a short while in the sixties before leaving for Bantam when Margrave went under. I googled Tom Harky, who has his own web page with contact info, and so I sent him a short email. It went like this: \"Dear Mr. Harky, I recently picked up an older, used book that was published by a now-defunct publishing house that you worked at until it closed. Do you remember much about your time at Margrave Press? If you do, I hope you can give me some information about a writer named R. Scabree, who wrote the book I'm reading. It's a horror novel called Scarecrow. Specifically, I'd like to know who it was who contributed the in-book artwork for the book, as it's very well-done, but I can't seem to find the name of the artist, and online info doesn't seem to help either. Any help you can offer on this would be appreciated.\" I also decided to google Wesley Childs, the artist who did the work for the front cover. He also has a website, but nowhere on it did I see the simple, yet evocative picture he had done for Scarecrow. In fact, nothing he had up on his website looked much like that. We'll see if I ever hear back from either man. UPDATE: Well, I am almost halfway through the book now. I decided to keep reading despite any misgivings I felt the other day. Scabree's skills with prose and dialogue haven't improved, but the story has taken a much darker turn. I guess I understand a little better why Yeats's \"The Second Coming\" was used as a quote now. As McCall's madness grows, the more he starts speaking in poetic, gloom-and-doom language, like the poem. He even quotes it a few times. At one point, he screams at the man leading the town assembly meeting that \"The best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity!\" He turns murderous later, and finally kills a fellow farmer, one that was the most outspoken that the Union should be formed, and just before slitting his throat hisses at him \"Things fall apart. The center cannot hold.\" My first reaction to this usage of the poem is to say \"bullshit\" because, honestly, it's like Scabree just liked the poem and thought it sounded scary, so he decided his murderous farmer would start spouting passages of it. There's no clue elsewhere that he's the kind of man who would even read Yeats. However, there is an Apocalyptic tone to the poem and the scarecrow has an Apocalyptic tone when he speaks to McCall. He warns him that the tide is turning and soon all innocence will be drowned, which also comes from \"The Second Coming\". Somehow, Scabree's able to make the lines sound like the scarecrow came up with them. Maybe he's not as bad a writer as I thought. Also, those pictures keep appearing. I swear earlier today I flipped ahead five or six pages to see when this chapter would be over, and there weren't any pictures. Just now I flipped to the third page, and I was greeted with this: I mean, what the hell is that!? It has nothing, literally nothing, to do with the story. And I could swear it wasn't there earlier today. Much like the others, those eyes, man. I want it to just be my imagination, but I swear they're looking at me, and seeing me. Writing it down like that it feels stupid. But all I can say is, read this damned thing for yourself and tell me it doesn't creep you out. UPDATE: Heard back from Wesley Childs today. He says he only barely remembers making that drawing. The dude is something like 80 now, and he was commissioned for that piece in the early 60's. He said he's never read the book himself, and that he only remembered the painting when I emailed him. He seemed surprised that anyone is reading this book in the modern age because according to him they only printed a handful of copies. He wasn't sure how many. He was not aware that anyone was hired to do in-book artwork or even that there was any. This inspired me to try and get a hold of Tom Harky again. I decided it had been long enough that I should have at least gotten a form response. So I sent a quick email to him asking if he'd had time to consider my request. Almost immediately, and I mean like five minutes after I hit \"Send\", I received this from what I guess is one of his staffers: \"Do not attempt to contact us again. We are blocking your email and your IP address. Further attempts at contact will be considered harassment and will be dealt with by the proper authorities.\" Whoa. I wasn't expecting that. I mean, I waited a week between emails and I was pretty polite both times. I'm trying not to read too much into that. I went back to the book today, still not sure if I had the constitution to keep reading it. I don't want to see those pictures again. I don't want to feel them looking at me. The scarecrow is not actually speaking to McCall, but it's clear that something is. Every time there's a mention of \"them,\" the next page has a photo of those strange silhouetted people and I have to believe it's just the way the artist had with his work that makes me sure that something is watching me from behind those pictures. Something that doesn't like me. And it isn't coming, it's already here. UPDATE: Okay, I'm sorry for the tone my review-as-I-go read has taken. I am trying very hard not to let my concerns show in my posts, but it's slipping through. I haven't had the strength to pick the book up since the last time I wrote. I got worse after receiving a second email from Wesley Childs. He apologized for lying to me and told me that the reason he didn't remember the scarecrow painting is that he had been purposefully trying to forget it. According to him, as he was painting it he kept hearing whispering from it, and once it was completed, he could swear it was coming to life and talking to him through his dreams. He mailed it as soon as he could and spent days after that trying to get rid of the feeling of being watched, or believing that he heard whispers. He says he's never made a painting like that before and never has been able to again. It was the first and last work he did for Margrave Press. He also told me that he met R. Scabree, but only once and that it was just a pen name. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what the man's real name was. He said Scabree was a small man, who seemed nervous all the time. I wrote back and asked him why he thinks Tom Harky would wish to block me and threaten me with the authorities just for asking about this book. He replied just a few minutes ago to tell me that Harky has been asked a couple of times before, during Q&A sessions, about his time at Margrave, and any time he is asked, he immediately concludes the session and walks out. He won't talk to anyone about Margrave. Childs himself once tried to reach any other contacts that commissioned him for the cover art, but he found none. It's as if Margrave Press never existed other than its tenuous connection to one man. UPDATE: It's been another week. Woke up this morning to an email from Tom Harky in my inbox. It wasn't the website address. It looked more like an account for personal use. It said only this: \"If you have that goddamn book in your house, burn it. Burn it right the fuck now.\" I haven't burnt it. It's on my coffee table right now. I can barely bring myself to look at it. Whatever is seeing me through that book can now see me even when it's closed. I have a feeling it's the Rough Beast, moving its slow thighs, slouching toward Bethlehem. Maybe that beast inspired the great poet William Butler Yeats to write about it, and just over forty years later inspired a hack writer who called himself R. Scabree to do the same. I don't know. I don't care anymore. I just want it to stop talking to me, dammit. UPDATE: I tried to burn it. I did. I used kitchen tongs and took it out to my backyard. I dropped it in an old steel bucket and struck a match. Then I held it there. I waited. I couldn't drop the match. Something was angry with me. Something was going to make sure that if I burned the book, I would feel every flame the book did tenfold. I put the match out and left the book in the bucket. I'm not going back for it. UPDATE: I've nearly finished the book. Somehow, I'm gonna make it. There have been no pictures for the last several pages. There don't need to be any. They see me through the words I read. They tell me what is going to happen. What has already been happening. I don't know why they would want me to know. Written by Josh Parker Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

I never saw its teeth", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Floyd Pinkerton", "Monsters", "NSFW", "We Go Bump"], "content": "I don't want to make it sound like I have a wicked stepmother. She's hardly a bitter old witch. She was a college student when my dad first brought her home to meet me, and was full of youthful spirit. She wasn't much different from the teenage babysitters I'd had, except for the part where she moved in permanently. She was beautiful in a modest way, with brown hair she wore in a conservative hairstyle and a fondness for turtleneck sweaters in muted colors. Overall, she had and still has all the qualities of a first-rate Nick at Nite-worthy mother. The worst thing she ever did was make me surrender to a monster. Since before I can remember, there was a vicious fiend in our house. I heard it gurgling and splashing and roaring and hissing and groaning. I saw it slither and twitch and glisten in the dim light. It would taunt me by appearing around corners then quickly retreating to its den. I never saw its teeth, but its surrogate jaws seemed powerful enough. It nested right around the corner from my bed. And the worst part was, every adult wanted me to feed it. I would have rather let its meals go to waste in my training pants. There's only one viable floor in our house. My dad stopped being Mr. Fix-It when my first mom left. Now he's got a different career and different hobbies. He probably doesn't even believe himself when he says he'll finish the house one day. As a result, the attic is a woolly death trap of fiberglass insulation, and the basement is a leaky dungeon. We basically have a house with one floor, and naturally there's only one bathroom. I've never really believed in my heart of hearts that that room was safe. Sure, the old house is full of places where creatures could hide in and move through unseen. I recall a tall and cadaverous headhunter in the basement, and a sheetlike jellyfish that slipped through the walls to visit every closet and cupboard. But the one in the plumbing scared me the most. I continued to fixate on it long after the other monsters had disappeared. My only episodic memory of my natural mother was her keeping me safe from this monster. It comes from the period of my life where memories are as hazy as dreams, and it's hard to tell which I'm recalling. But as I see it in my mind's eye, I was walking to the bathroom to take care of business like a big boy when I caught a glimpse of something horrifying in the twilight of the night light. A dark thing that gleamed like wet tar held the toilet lid just a tiny bit above the seat. \"Mommy, Mommy!\" I cried. She came rushing in to see what was the matter, scaring the monster back into its hiding place. By that time the big boy ship had sailed, but my mom comforted me, changed me, and acted like she believed me. She even stayed in bed with me so I could go to sleep, even though I knew the monster sometimes ventured out of its watery lair. But soon she was gone. My dad was understanding, but rather stern. After much coaxing, lecturing, and a few harsh words, he eventually convinced me that every other toilet in the world was safe, and even this one was safe during the daytime. I still believed in a plumbing monster that could harm me in the night, but this was the greatest victory he could hope for. I made the transition from training pants to Treasure Planet underwear and started kindergarten only one year later than a child without a disabling phobia would have. There was still the problem of the night. It didn't matter if the lights were all on indoors, or if my big strong dad was right there to protect me. I just couldn't risk a monster attack. Even leaving my bed seemed like a putting my life on the line. So my dad let me keep an empty Smuckers jar next to my bed. By the time the new mom moved in I had advanced to a Ball jar hidden in my nightstand that I was expected to wash with the dishes every evening. Little else had changed. By then I wasn't convinced that there was a monster, and I told my dad that I didn't really believe in it, but I was still scared. That sort of fear that makes you believe you'll fail a test you've already handed in just because you told your friends you'd nailed it. That strong fear without strong belief is in everyone, and it was certainly present in me all the nights I sat on the edge of my bed with my most sensitive organ resting on the lip of a cold glass jar. It was humiliating, but the humiliation never outweighed the fear. That is, until the first time my stepmother cleaned my room. I snuck the jar out and vowed to never use it again. I thought I could do better for my new mom, my new friend. This was a terrible mistake. My dad's work kept him away from home more and more. Pretty soon my mom was caring for me almost exclusively. It was like I'd exchanged one parent for another, one of no real relation who would have been in her early teens when I was born. It felt different having her in charge, and very different having to answer to her when I did something wrong. Before long, I was doing something wrong pretty often. It was because of the plumbing monster, of course. When night fell and the house was full of mysterious noises I couldn't bring myself to approach those porcelain jaws. I certainly tried. I would walk out of my bedroom and into the hallway, turn the corner, walk up to the open bathroom door, then realize I just couldn't do it. My last trip to the bathroom at sunset had to last me until the morning light. Some nights, perhaps most, I made it. It was hard drifting off without feeling comfortable inside, and I'd wake up with a bladder so full it was excruciating, but I could manage it some nights. On many nights I didn't. I'd toss and turn and feel worse and worse. It would get to where it seemed like there was a sea urchin nesting in my pelvis, sticking its spines deeper and deeper into my soft tissue. Eventually I'd hear that familiar hissing sound, then fall asleep in the damp, muggy warmth. No one even mentioned it the first time it happened. I knew my mom knew, because she had my bed looking and smelling fine when I came home from school, but she didn't say a word about it. She probably thought it was a fluke, and didn't want to embarrass me over something that would never be important again. But by a week or so, maybe a month, a clear trend had emerged. My mom confronted me about the accidents. I let slip that I wasn't really a bedwetter because I was always awake when I peed. She went through the roof. \"You'd better have a good reason for that,\" she said in a very mommish tone. \"I do!\" I asserted. \"Somebody's keeping me out of the bathroom, and I can't always hold it 'til I fall asleep.\" As I recall, that explanation calmed her down a little. It didn't last, though. \"Oh, sweetie,\" she began, \"if you ever need to use the bathroom badly and I'm in there, or your father is, you can just knock on the door and tell us. It's not hard to hurry up and let you go. You don't have to wait if you can't.\" \"It's not you. It's the monster that lives in the plumbing.\" That set her off worse than before. When my dad came home, I ran to him sobbing. \"Daddy, Daddy! Mommy's being mean to me!\" were my most likely words. Once we'd both presented our cases, all he had to say was, \"Listen to your mother.\" She said the sort of things I'd heard for years. Monsters weren't real. All the noises in the house had explanations, even if my father with a background in home repair couldn't explain every one. No adult had ever seen this monster. My parents used the toilet at night all the time, and they were both still alive. These arguments were old hat. I dismissed them all, and refused to promise I'd risk my life to protect some cloth. My mom \"forbid\" me from wetting the bed, but that didn't mean anything. She shot down my dad's suggestion that I go back to using a container. \"We don't live in the nineteenth century,\" she told me in an unnecessarily educational outburst. \"You do not get to keep a chamber pot under your bed. We have the modern miracle of indoor plumbing and you are going to use it, day or night. Do I make myself clear?\" Nothing was resolved that day. The only change to the status quo was that I got yelled at each time I lost control of my body during the night. But it wasn't long before my mom came upon a means of enforcing her ban on bedwetting. It was a night like many others. I was lying in bed filled with fear and urine. Without the option to void my aching system, I was trying to fall asleep when I happened to cough. My mom was fortunate enough to be in earshot. \"Are you awake in there?\" she called through the wall. \"Yes.\" \"Do you have to pee?\" I paused, not sure if it was worse to lie or to deal with the consequences of telling the truth. She spoke again before I answered. \"Just to be safe, you should go pee.\" I got out of bed, turned on my light, and walked out my bedroom door sideways, with my back to the northern half of the doorframe. That way I could see and react if the monster lunged out of the bathroom. The room was in darkness, but I could see just enough to tell something was moving. I stood there for some time, trying to summon up the courage to walk forward and turn on the light. \"Are you in the bathroom yet?\" my mom asked from the other room. \"Almost.\" I kept my feet planted well away from the bathroom door as I leaned forward and stretched my left arm out. It took a couple tries to hit the light switch, but when I succeeded my fears were confirmed. The toilet lid was about halfway up. The monster especially bold that night. I could see it clearer than ever before. Its body was a very dark reddish orange, almost like molasses. A long strip of glistening flesh was lolling over the seat like a tongue. A nozzle-like appendage was sticking out sideways to its left. But the worst part was smack in the middle, and was holding the lid up. It was a long neck or tentacle that ended in a single eye. It was smooth and bright orange, like fire trapped in a marble. It had a pupil shaped like four-armed starfish, which glared at me with unfathomable malice. I was only half-surprised by this scene. My belief in the plumbing monster had been eroded over the years, but part of me had known it was real all along. Most boys in my place would have wet themselves then and there, but I was a veteran of monster encounters, and I didn't waste much time before I acted. \"Mommy, Mommy!\" I shouted at the top of my lungs. \"The monster's here! Come see it!\" Once I heard her coming I ran back into my room and dove under the covers. I hoped to hear a scream as she saw the monster, but instead I heard a stern lecture. \"Young man, we have been over this. There is no monster in the plumbing. That's what little kids believe, not ten-year-olds.\" I came out from under the covers to argue face to face. My mom was standing my bedroom doorway wearing a nightgown in some muted color. \"But I just saw it! It had a tongue and a big orange...\" \"People get put in the crazy house for saying things like that. Now stop telling me nonsense, stop making a racket, and go finish what you got up to do.\" I protested, but she marched over to my bed, grabbed me by the wrist, yanked me out of bed, and led me around the corner. She opened the toilet lid and pointed at the bowl, which contained nothing but clear water. She only said one word: \"Go.\" \"It'll just come back,\" I explained, but my mom was resolute. \"I'm right here. Nothing's gonna happen to you.\" Then she turned to face the wall and give her boy a little privacy. I hoped this grown-up was enough to keep the monster at bay, but I doubted it. I reached to lift up the seat, and jumped back when I saw something dart out of the hole at the bottom of the bowl. Both seat and lid fell down with a clatter. A tongue stuck out between them and licked its lips. \"It's back!\" I yelped as I grabbed for the doorknob. My mom stopped me. \"There's nothing here,\" she said, which was true at the moment and probably true by the time she had looked. She moved to block the door, faced me, and repeated the command. \"Go.\" I began another argument, but she cut me off. \"I don't want to hear another word out of you, young man. Just go.\" I remember staring into my reflection in the toilet lid as I procrastinated over lifting it. When I finally did, there was nothing menacing underneath. I lifted the seat up. Still nothing. I paused. I opened the hole in the front of my tighty whities, then paused some more. I guess I stalled for too long. Without warning, my mom took hold of my penis and aimed it at the toilet bowl. \"Pee,\" she ordered. \"But there's a monster!\" She stung my eyes with a look that injected terror into my blood, then stared expectantly at my prepubescent private parts. \"If I have to wash your sheets one more time, you'll be better off with the monster,\" she spat. As if it heard its name called, the monster began to make a racket. I heard a loud and lusty \"glug glug glug!\" Large bubbles rose to the surface. I closed my eyes, afraid the creature would show its awful face again. The water that had been welling up in them streamed down my face. I tried to jerk myself away from my mom, but it was no use. \"Pee!\" she shouted, her fingernails digging into my skin. \"The monster's right here!\" \"I don't care if it is!\" she countered venomously. What choice did I have? I somehow blocked the fear and shyness out of my brain and concentrated only on the muscles in my body. There was a drizzle for a few seconds before my equipment seized up. \"Keep peeing!\" my mom barked, as if I had stopped on purpose. I summoned another tentative trickle, which relieved pressure from my aching bladder in fits and starts before finally gaining strength and becoming a useful stream. I felt like I stood there for hours in the spotlight with the lurking monster and the furious stepmother who didn't trust me with my own penis. My face was wet with tears, and my chest and throat were periodically seized with hiccough-like weeping. The outpouring from my urinary tract finally ebbed, then stopped entirely. \"Are you done?\" my mom asked. All I could do was nod. She shook my penis like a dog trying to snap a snake's neck, freeing me of the final droplets. Then she tucked it back into my underpants and flushed the toilet. I just stood there, head hanging low. \"That wasn't so bad, now, was it?\" she said. Then she shooed me out of the room because she needed to sit on the toilet she'd proven harmless. I didn't let the plumbing monster keep me out of the bathroom after that. I was more worried about the monster who slept with my dad. Over time, even those harsh feelings faded away. I was a child with an overactive imagination, and she'd solved that problem without even having to pay a psychiatrist. Before too long, I'd forgiven her and forgotten the monster. It was all buried in the past. On a night not so long ago, something exhumed that old memory and phobia. My dad started renovating the bathroom before he had to leave town, and now a large rectangle has been skinned from the western wall. I expect it to be there for some time, and I've made the most of it. It's actually pretty interesting. If you look in the right direction you can see yards of open space in the wall, with nails jutting out like teeth. There are gaps in the boards leading to more empty space that's impossible to see. There are spiderwebs everywhere in there, so I know that there are not only many spiders living in our walls but a population of insects to sustain them. There are also scraps of paper, chips of red terra cotta from a potentially beautiful brick wall buried somewhere out of sight, rock like fragments of other building materials, and other less obvious things. I fished one out using a coat hanger because I was so curious. I thought it was probably a rotten old banana peel, but I wondered how it could have fallen inside the wall. It was actually a dead bat. There's a whole country in the walls that I never see. That was an intriguing and somewhat disquieting realization. So the whole idea of hidden creatures was fresh in my mind the night of the event I'm about to describe. It was the middle of the night, I was in bed, and something seemed wrong. First it was a strange noise, then the vague impression of something moving in the dark. My mild unease escalated to anxiety when I heard what I could have sworn was the laptop on my desk closing. My heart raced, and I curled into a fetal position, unsure what else to do. I hadn't been this frightened by anything in years. It was childish. There is nothing in the dark that isn't there when the lights are on. The rational part of me had fully realized that years ago. But the irrational, emotional part still responded like a little boy to the slight suggestion that there was some Bogeyman in my room. I felt a very strong sensation of wrongness that seemed to permeate my entire darkened room like some supernatural poison and filled my entire body with profound disquietude. I also had to pee. Eventually I would have to get out of bed, monster or no monster. I really wished I wasn't in that situation. I wished I knew for certain that the sounds were just the house settling and the movement was only in my mind. I wished I could just forget my fears and go to sleep. I wished I could find relief of my need without getting out of bed and moving through a potentially demon-haunted room. But no amount of wishing could erase the fear in my mind or the urgent sensation in my bladder. I had to face the unknown terror to get to the bathroom. This is silly , I told myself. I'm a teenager in high school afraid to go pee because there could be a monster in my room. On further reflection, it was even sillier than that. Hundreds of times every year I thought I was seeing something or hearing something in my darkened room, and it had never once turned out to be anything. Not even a mouse. The only times I'd \"seen\" a real \"threat\" were years ago when my rational mind was rudimentary and I was almost a different person. When I thought about how unreasonable what I felt was, my hand barely hesitated in switching the lamp on. \"Don't be afraid,\" a voice from the direction of my desk said. My blood chilled, and the air in my room grew thin. Half illuminated by the lamp on my nightstand, sitting on my desk, was what I can only describe as a monster. Its shadowy shape recoiled from the light. Then it straightened itself into a rippling sheet and poured down the side of my desk, collecting on the chair next to it. The wooden backing hid most of it from the light and my vision, so all I could see was a dark pile of something with little legs or feelers twitching about. My verbal reaction to this spectacle wasn't exactly profound. \"Oh...my...God. A monster.\" \"I suppose you could call me that,\" the thing said. \"I'm not in any of the planet's major phyla.\" \"What do you want with me?\" I asked it. I suppose I should call it \"him.\" \"Nothing. I came here to take someone home. He died here years ago, but we couldn't retrieve the body until now.\" I was awestruck. I don't think I need to explain the ramifications of what I'd just seen and heard, or the many avenues of speculation it opened up. It just changed everything I thought I knew. \"How did you get in here?\" I asked. I was expecting to hear something about magic, parallel universes, folded space, or other such wonders. His answer was, \"Through the dryer vent, across the basement ceiling, through the heat register, and over the desk that's blocking it.\" That made sense, because that register was one of several that weren't connected to ducts and simply led to cavities in the basement's open ceiling. More of my dad's unfinished work. \"I'm sorry to intrude on your bedroom, but I can't get to the body without going through here.\" \"Where is this body?\" \"We're not sure, but we've narrowed it down. Getting it to its rightful resting place will be harder than finding it.\" Throughout the conversation I thought about turning on the overhead light and getting my camera out of my desk. I never did, because I was afraid to leave my bed. The monster seemed friendly enough, but I thought he might turn nasty if he thought I was going to impede his mission or jeopardize his secrecy. There was also the fact that I'd woken up with an extremely pronounced and persistent erection that would have been obvious once the covers were out of the way. So I stayed in bed while my guest went about his task. The bunched-up monster startled me when he began to move in strange ways. I guess he was looking around, but there wasn't any continuous motion, and the jerks and shudders weren't localized to any one part. His whole body would twitch and reposition itself every few seconds, as if I were watching video that was randomly fast-forwarded every so often. I was startled even worse when he suddenly made a move for the window. I was interested in seeing what he looked like, but his speed and the low light were both working against me. He fell out of the chair and rapidly scuttled to where he was adhering to the window next to my bed. \"Scuttled\" might be the wrong word, since it reads like a sound effect and this was without any noticeable sounds, but it's the best way I can describe the lightning-quick movement of this thing that was almost all legs. When he was on the window he was behind the curtains, so I didn't see many details as he unlatched the window and forced it open. He accomplished the latter task by scrunching himself up like an inchworm then straightening out. This might seem funny to read, but it was unnerving in person. Every one of this thing's movements made it seem scarier. Sometimes it's hard to write \"him\" instead of \"it.\" After opening the screen he scuttled backwards into the hallway, turned himself around in a quick fluid motion, and disappeared into the bathroom. I soon heard the distinct gravelly sound of something moving inside the wall. It's a sound I've gotten to know well, both from my dad's handiwork and from the mice and bats that have been in the walls over the years. At least, I thought they were all mice or bats. Again I considered fetching the camera, but the monster was back before I knew it, giving me a little start. He was carrying a cigar-shaped bundle on his back. He paused in the middle of the floor, probably thinking about how he was going to carry this outside, and the final foot or so of his body was in the light. I was finally able to see something of this monster, but my attention was drawn to the thing poking out of the cloth wrapping. It was a silvery grey head about the size and shape of a furless male raccoon's head. The mouth was sort of like a wildcat's, and there was a mosaic of scales where the nose should have been. Appendages growing from the sides of its lower jaw had broken off, forming stumps of various lengths. There were two pairs of gaping holes where I assumed the eyes had been. They must have been much smaller than I thought, just like so many other things I remembered from my childhood. It didn't look scary at all. It looked sad. This monster, which probably had family and friends, had died far away from home, and sat rotting in our wall instead of being laid to rest properly. He had never meant me any harm, but I'd hated him. I got a little choked up. \"I'm sorry if any of us have frightened you,\" the live monster said to me before he moved along. \"We bear no ill will toward the educated chordates. We wish you the best of everything.\" I didn't know what to say. I did finally find my tongue just before the monster disappeared into the night with his departed comrade. \"Nobody's going to believe me,\" I told him. He paused on the windowsill. \"I'll see what I can do about that.\" With those words he crawled out of the house, closing the window and screen behind him. Once he was gone I walked into the bathroom and used the toilet without fear. I smiled as I transformed the water's calm surface into a foamy yellow tempest. This room would never be dangerous again. Better still, I understood that it had never been dangerous in the first place. The next morning there was a card lying on my nightstand. It was a photograph of one of the monsters resting on a bed of rocks on a sunny seashore. I turned it over. The back read, \"Hot Spot 11, C. J. R. Boygins, 30949-53.\" Below the English was a line of blocky hieroglyphics and another of tangled squiggles and circles. I now held in my hands the proof I had never had before. My mom was in the bathroom, but I couldn't wait. I pounded on the door a few seconds after I heard the shower shut off. \"Mom, Mom! I've got something to show you! It's incredible! Are you decent?\" When she let me in, I held out the photograph. She adjusted the fuzzy white bath towel she was wearing and leaned over to get a close look, trying to focus her contact-free eyes. She didn't say anything. I stared at the photograph too as I told her about my monster encounter the night before. Then I realized something that made me stop my story mid-sentence. The monster in the photo was long and thin, and its body shone in the sunlight. That much matched how I pictured the plumbing monster. This monster was an orange-tan color, not far from human flesh. Besides the mammal or reptile-like head and the unfathomable shapes at the other end, its body was entirely covered in armor divided up into segments. Each segment had a pair of spindly legs like on a daddy longlegs, and many had a shorter secondary pair with fingers, suckers, or both. All in all, it matched the bits of the monsters I had glimpsed the night before, but bore almost no resemblance to the one I'd spent most of my life fearing. The most troubling part was that it had four blue eyes with round black pupils. I hadn't seen a trace of that bathroom beast in years, so I couldn't be sure I remembered exactly what it looked like, but that diamond-pupilled eye from my memories haunted me. That part had to be accurate. \"This isn't the right monster,\" I mumbled quietly as my brain soaked up the disquieting implications. \"This just proves that the house's monsters are real, and the plumbing one is still at large.\" My mom smiled, looking genial and maybe a little condescending. \"Oh, sweetie,\" she began, \"I know for a fact there's no monster in the plumbing.\" \"How?\" I asked with wavering voice. \"Because,\" she replied in a stern tone. For a moment I thought that was all she had to say, but she continued to explain her reasoning. \"...It crawled out of there years ago.\" I just stood there dumbfounded. Is this a joke? I wondered. Is there more to it? The silence was suddenly broken by a gurgling and churning noise. It was louder than any of the strange noises that normally permeated the house, and sounded even less like it belonged in a human dwelling. But it wasn't coming from the toilet, the tub, the sink, or any of the walls around me. It was emanating from the middle of my mom. I should have looked away when she let the towel drop to the floor, but somehow I couldn't. I was paralyzed, eyes wide, as my nude stepmother turned around, bent over, and placed a hand on either side of her round bottom. With her fingers pressing into her flesh, turning the rosy post-shower hue into a deathly white, she pulled her cheeks outward. Her anus puckered, domed, and widened. I could see something that didn't belong. The orifice grew wider and wider, finally stopping at four inches in diameter. Much wider than that was the partly extruded sphere. In an instant, its molasses surface retracted to reveal the fiery orange eye from my traumatic childhood memories. \"It's in my plumbing now.\" Written by Floyd Pinkerton (Lee Sherman)"}

Through his years as a performing artist and a piano player, he had cultivated a bizarre and freakish personality, which earned him much notoriety around the Home Counties. He was not world famous, nor nationwide, but mainly thought to be a local sensation. He played the piano religiously as a young child but did not become a professional until well into his 30s. His first ever concert was at a bar in Soho, 1972, and since then he had been building on his reputation. What made him significant was his ability to flaunt his sexuality and link it with his own music. What’s more, he also liked to dress himself as a woman. This was a unique aspect of his stage persona, and he succeeded so well in this regard that it was impossible to tell at first glance whether he was male or female. Indeed, since he usually spoke with an abnormally high-pitched voice, and that in all his mannerisms he was largely effeminate, he sounded just like a woman too. His timing in entering the public scene also coincided with Britain’s generation of LGBT performers who were entering the public limelight; David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, and the like. Capitalising on this gay revolution, as it were, Geraldine Atkins was indeed, a star. His fame and his infamy (he was rumoured to be a male prostitute, and continually harassed by the police) declined gradually into the 21st century, but in all his foppish and fabulous splendour, he was still very much in the game. As a pianist, his material was neither bawdy, nor risqué, and in fact actually sounded much reminiscent of some of the old-fashioned and respectable love ballads that he enjoyed hearing as a young child; mainly from 1920s Broadway productions, or even songs set during the wars. However, he was first and foremost a composer, and for inspiration, he looked directly up to the likes of Noel Coward and Liberace. Right at this point, dressed in a pretty pink frock, with a straw ladies’ hat, he was playing his song which he had written in the style of a wartime ballad: “Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain…” “Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain… On the parchment of history ‘tis written O, how our enemies shall soon be smitten Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain… When his performance ended, he was met with a round of applause, and cutely bowed before his audience three times, then closed his piano down, and walked straight over to the counter for a drink. He had often wondered whether his fame was down to pure merit, or simply down to the controversy, but then he had never wanted to find out. By the end of his performance, he drove off in his 1980s BMW, retreating back to his cottage in the country. As he drove past, there was a notice on a nearby telegraph pole, conspicuous enough to be seen from 50 yards away, with a picture of a teenage girl’s face on it. The notice read: “MISSING PERSON: SAMANTHA GREENWAY, AGE 16 On the 20th March at around 3:30 PM, Samantha Greenway was walking home from school when she disappeared. She was last spotted in Elmsley Common, wearing a pink dress and carrying a brown leather handbag. She is 16 years old, has brown hair, blue eyes, and is 5ft10. If you have any information that may lead to her whereabouts, then please dial 999. -Surrey County Police” The girl in the picture was really pretty. She had a charming, youthful and innocent smile, with delightful white teeth, and adorable blue-green eyes. As Geraldine pulled into his driveway, he parked and moved carefully out of his old banger of a car. Then, not forgetting his parasol and his walking stick, he entered his old cottage. He carefully balanced his stick and his parasol in the closet, then walked into the kitchen. He put on the kettle, and as he did, Grimalkin purred as she leapt up near the kitchen sink. He gently stroked her black fur, as the kettle grew noisier. Then he remembered to feed her. “There’s a good puss… good girl…” he murmured. Once the kettle was singing, he poured himself some Earl Grey, gently blew over it, and then took a sip. There was a quiet rattling noise, coming from somewhere within the house. Geraldine sprang into action; like he had almost forgotten. “Gosh! I need to check on my new guest, don't I!?” He carefully hobbled along to a door next to that of the living room. He fetched a key from his ring, unlocked then opened it, and walked down the stairs which lead into what looked like a downstairs attic. It had a creaky wooden floor, and the walls were wooden and bare. The room was cold, as it did not have central heating. In fact, it wasn’t even part of the floor plan. Geraldine had dug and manufactured it himself. In a remote corner of the room was a metal cage with iron bars, lying in the corner frightened, was Samantha Greenway. * Annabel and her friends were really excited. She had never owned a dollhouse before, and she could barely contain herself. It was the best birthday present she’d ever had, and as far as she knew, probably the only one she’d need for years to come. All of her friends were here, celebrating this magnificent model with her. “Let’s let Susie in the bedroom!” “No Susie can’t be there, it’s not her bedtime!” Just at that moment, Mother walked in, with a wide-eyed toddler beside her. “Girls?” she called out. “Gerald wants to play with you. Are you going to let him?” Annabel sighed. Not this again. Why couldn’t Gerald play with his own friends? “But Mummy! Gerald’s a boy! Boys can’t play with us!” Mother cooed. “Please… look at him. He loves his big sister. He desperately wants to play with you. Don’t you dear, Gerald?” Gerald looked really happy, but didn’t know how to express himself. Annabel groaned. “I wish I had a younger sister instead.” Mother opened the door. “I don’t want to hear any arguing. Is that clear? Just let Gerald play with your dolls, and be nice to him.” Gerald toddled over to his older sister, and pointed to the house, which was almost bigger than he was. In an effort to get attention, he announced in front of Annabel and her friends, in as much English as he could, “It’s big!” Annabel’s friends were beginning to feel sorry for him. “Come over here, Gerald, help Susan get dressed for her day at school.” “No! Wendy! Gerald can’t play with dolls! Don’t let him touch her!” This made Gerald very upset. He started to cry, and suddenly all of Annabel’s friends were enchanted by him. They all gathered around him, and did their best to calm him down. Annabel stood there defiantly. “He can’t play with us, Wendy. He’s a boy. Boys aren’t allowed to play with girls.” Then immediately, one of Annabel’s friends had an idea. “I know!” shouted Barbara, with sudden excitement. “Let’s turn him into a girl!” The other girls snickered at this. Gerald was happy that he was getting all this lovely attention. “No, you can’t do that Barbara!” Annabel retorted, as if she was telling her off. “Yes we can!” shouted Daisy. “All we need to do is make him wear a dress!” This made every girl’s eyes light up. Gerald didn’t know what was going on, but he felt that something fun was about to happen. “Annabel, can we use one of your frocks?” asked Wendy. Annabel was hesitant at first, but after all her friends insisted, she reluctantly ran upstairs to her chest of drawers, pulling out a small, crumpled children’s white frock, patterned with acorns and leaves. With diligent care, she eased it over Gerald, who willingly stood as still as he could. All of Annabel’s friends gasped, then giggled. “He looks beautiful!” said Daisy. “She looks beautiful!” corrected Eileen. Gerald turned around, admiring the smiles he got from his new friends. Annabel, however, was still not convinced. “He’s still not one of us” she muttered, obstinately… * Samantha was lying against the far corner of her cage, feeling rather tired. She had little memory of what happened last night. She was walking back from school, when an elderly lady was walking near her. She continued on her course… when suddenly she fell into a deep sleep. What happened? Why would she just fall asleep in the middle of a wood? That’s just bizarre… She soon felt more alert, and her head was beginning to feel sore from where her head had been resting against the iron bars of the cage… a cage! She was in a cage! She was still feeling partly woozy from her long sleep, and wasn’t sure if this was a dream or not. But the loud rattle of the cage door assured her that this was no dream. She did not recognise any of her surroundings; she had never been anywhere like this before. Had she been kidnapped? Then, hearing a door open from not far away, and the gentle patter of footsteps, she noticed a strange feminine figure enter the room, and the turning on of a light. She began to feel really frightened. She had no idea where she was, but was clearly nowhere familiar. And her phone and purse had been taken. Where was she? And who was that person at the other side of the room she saw? Soon, the figure moved closer. Samantha was beginning to question in her head whether it was male or female. They were wearing a pink dress, but also had a fairly ambiguous body frame and facial profile. She waited to hear this person speak, so that she would find out. Then, she remembered! That old lady she’d seen in the park! This was her! She noticed the “old lady” walking beside her, then all of a sudden she gripped her tightly and smothered her face with a napkin, which must have been laced with some sort of sleeping agent. That’s why she felt sleepy. Then, the figure presented their face to the front of the cage. Even now she was still uncertain whether her captor was a man or a woman. “Are you awake?” Geraldine asked her. The figure spoke with soft, feminine voice – it was impossible to tell what their sex was. Maybe she’d never find out. But she felt much too frightened to ask. “Time to wake up.” Geraldine rang in a monotone. Samantha moved towards the source of the voice, and uttered weakly, “Who – who are you? What have you done to me?” Geraldine rose and turned away. “I’ve taken you to my secret room, darling. I need you here.” Samantha had no clue what was going on. “First, I need your dress.” Samantha began to fear the worst. She looked at him, feeling more and more freaked out by each passing second. “My – my dress?” “Yes dear, I need your dress. Kindly take it off, please.” Samantha curled into a ball. “Please… don’t… don’t hurt me!” “I won’t harm you if you do exactly as I say. Take off your dress, now.” Samantha wondered if he was being serious. “And… if I do… you’ll – you promise you won’t hurt me?” Geraldine was beginning to feel more and more impatient. “For God’s sake, you little bitch! Just take off that dress now!” She yelped, and began to undress. She tried not to pay any attention to the eerie gaze of this bizarre person who was carefully looking at her. Once she had removed it, she handled it with great care, and bundled her dress together. “He – here..” she delicately extended her dress. Now, wearing nothing more than her undergarments, she was beginning to feel more exposed to the cold air, and goosebumps were appearing all over her delicate skin. Then, to Samantha’s own amazement, the strange figure of a person took her dress away, and did not seem intent on harming her. Instead, he began to strip himself, with a view to wearing it himself. Now, seeing his hirsute bodily figure, she was beginning to feel more certain that she was talking to a man. A man wearing ladies’ knickers, and a brassiere. Samantha was feeling perplexed, and more and more uncertain of her fate. She had read one or two horror stories in the news about deranged lunatics who kidnapped girls around her age, and forced them into all kinds of degrading sexual acts, before savagely killing them. She began to bite her lip… she did not want to die. Not like this. And she was absolutely freezing. Where was her family now? What about the police? Were they all busy searching for her? And this weirdo – who on earth was he? Was he a registered sex offender, on their wanted list? She’d never seen him around the neighbourhood before. She was beginning to regret being so blissfully ignorant of the goings-on in the local county. Once Geraldine put on Samantha’s dress, he began to pirouette with practised diligence, then curtsied right in front of her. What was he going to do now? Was he going to ask her to take off her bra and knickers too? Instead, Geraldine headed back to the stairs leading out of the basement. No! How long was he going for? In this freezing cold! How was she going to survive? * “I know what we need to make her more beautiful!” exclaimed Wendy, “Let’s put a tiara on her head, and then she’ll be a princess!” Annabel just stood in front of all her friends, wistfully longing for their attention. To her, this was nothing short of unspeakable. Blasphemous. And yet, none of her friends seemed to care – dressing her baby brother in all manner of frocks, and giving her all sorts of inappropriate headwear. And to top it all off, he had stolen away all her friends just by being cute. Annabel didn’t even think he was that cute, really. He was three years old – two years her junior, and yet, he was the one who commanded the respect of girls older than him. It was not fair! “Come on, Annabel, help us!” Annabel couldn’t take it anymore. She stormed out of the room and walked to the garden, where she saw Mother watering the roses. Everything in the garden looked so much more beautiful and appealing than what she was seeing in there. It was peaceful and sunny. A perfect distraction from- “-Anna… Annabel!” She turned around, and saw Gerald - (of all people!) running towards her. She was surprised; he even sounded like a girl now. And now he followed her here. He was clearly mocking her. “Gerald!? Is that you?” Mother called out, bewildered. Once she came up close and saw everything, she burst out laughing. “Annabel… look! You’ve made Gerald into a lady now! Now you have a little sister!” Annabel was cross. She folded her arms. “He’s not my sister, Mummy. He’s just being really silly. Everyone’s being silly. They think he’s a girl.” Mother still could barely control herself. “Geraldine!” She moved forward and picked him up in her arms. “From now on, your name shall be Geraldine.” “But Mummy!” she wailed. “It’s not fair! Boys aren’t supposed to play dress up like that!” Mother turned affectionately to her eldest. “Annabel, my dear… why can’t you just pretend like everybody else? He doesn’t mind!” To this, Gerald smiled in approval. Annabel couldn’t. There was no way. As long as Gerald was a… … ...Wait! Annabel suddenly had a thought. A most brilliant idea! What if she decided to really make Gerald into a girl? Then instead of an annoying little brother, she could have a pretty young sister instead! Imagine how well they would get on, and how much they’d be able to share together – it would be just perfect! And she knew exactly how she was going to do it. But she would probably need some help from her friends first. She rushed inside the house, leaving Gerald behind in a hurry. … All her friends gasped at this suggestion. “But that’s even more wrong!” objected Daisy. “Mummy will be very cross!” “No!” Annabel insisted, “It’s perfect! It will really work!” “But he is a girl now; we just made him one!” protested Eileen. “No he isn’t really. It’s just pretend,” responded Annabel. “But when we do this, we won’t have to pretend anymore.” Soon Annabel’s friends were all taken by this suggestion. A mischievous smile formed on each their faces. They were all planning to do something really naughty. “When shall we do it?” asked Wendy? “Let’s do it tomorrow morning!” said Daisy. And once they happily reached a decision, then all resolved to walk outside and accompany Gerald. They took him to the swings and slides. Now Annabel was happy. Lifting young Gerald onto the slide, Annabel began to push. “Soon Gerald, you really will be my little sister!” Annabel’s friends giggled mercilessly at this. Gerald laughed, still not knowing what was going on… * Samantha could see the vapour from her breath as she exhaled. It was so cold in this dank little basement. How long had she been waiting here for? How much longer would she last? While busy dwelling on this, however, a shadow protruding in the basement told her that her captor had returned. He was carrying what looked like an umbrella, and a CD player. He plugged the CD in the wall. “Umm… excuse me… excuse me… sir?” Samantha’s captor stopped dead in his tracks and turned slowly towards her. “I’m… I’m really cold. Can I… Can I have my dress back?” Something appeared to snap in the crazy man’s eyes. “What did you just say, dear?” “I…” she began, nervously “I’m just… so cold. I’d really like my dress back.” The man looked like he was beginning to calm down. “Yes… yes… your dress. You’d like your dress back. I’ll umm… I’ll get you-” He turned back and began to fumble around in a small wooden box. “Get you… get you your-” Then once he’d found what he was looking for, he turned around, and retrieved what appeared to be a whip. “WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME!?” Samantha shrieked, and curled into a ball. “Sir!? SIR!? SIR!? Do I look like a SIR to you!??” flipped the madman. Then, he began to reach through the cage, and whip her hard over her bare legs and shoulders. She wailed and howled at the stinging pain. “You… you bitch! You rude little bitch! You bitch, you bitch, you rude, naughty little bitch!” Samantha did her best to apologise, despite the pain she suffered from her flogging. “I’m sorry – I’m so sorry – I’m so sorry- I’m so sorry... Miss.. Ms! Madame! Madame, please don’t hurt me! I’m so sorry - I swear! I won’t call you that I swear! I won’t call you that again!” Geraldine moved closer to the cage. He began to undress again. “Look at this!” he exclaimed. The old man then dropped his knickers, and Samantha saw something that was freakishly disgusting. What she saw was no recognisable part of human anatomy. It was what appeared to be an empty space with a bright pink trail of torn stitch marks where a distinct lump mass of flesh was missing. There was a small plastic tube that ran midway through it. It made him look neither male nor female. If anything, it made him resemble Frankenstein’s monster. Whatever it was that happened down there, it looked the result of several botched surgical operations that had been done by no professional. Samantha held her nose and covered her eyes. She was going to be sick. She couldn’t bear to look at it any longer. “Huh!?” Geraldine quizzed. “You think this is disgusting!? Well, aren’t you a delightful little thing!? I was looking forward to both of us revelling in our shared womanhood together!” Samantha could not hold it in any longer. She puked all over the cage floor. Geraldine rolled his eyes and began to lose his temper. “You are just like everybody else…” he spluttered “You…-You don’t know what it’s like… you live an ordinary life… you’ve never even thought to question what you were! In another life… in another universe… I could have been just as beautiful and insipid as you.” Then, pulling up his knickers, he thwacked the cage door in frustration. There was a loud clink noise. Samantha did her best to distance herself from the pile of sick. “Now…” he began. “First, you’re going to clean up that pile of sick, and then we’re going to try this again from the start.” He rummaged through his box and found an old tea towel and some Febreeze. “As soon as… as… as soon…” The old man started to feel faint. His face slurred, and half of his face appeared to lag as if it was no longer functioning. He looked as if he was having a stroke. “As… soon as we…” Then, he tumbled down and collapsed in front of the cage door, and after nearly a whole minute writing in helplessness, he passed out cold on the floor. Samantha noticed he was carrying what looked like a set of keys in his right hand. It was too far away for her arms to reach, so, carefully navigating around the pile of vomit, she reached out with her bare leg and clasped onto it. Success! She quickly tested all the different keys (There were six) on the cage lock, and soon enough, she was free. She immediately snatched her dress off the lifeless old man lying before her, and wanted to bolt for the exit, immediately but stopped herself. She looked at the deranged geriatric lying on the ground, and for some reason, even she couldn’t understand, she pitied him. Whatever it was that turned him into this, she reasoned that he was, some way or another, completely wrecked by something traumatic that happened to him as a child. Then, she snapped out of her pitying trance at once, and made her way up the basement stairs as quickly as she could… …Geraldine awoke. Where was the girl gone? She was there in her cage just a few minutes ago. What happened? The pile of sick was still there… but the door was open. How… The keys! She’d taken the keys. Geraldine let out a deep sigh of resignation. This was it. He’d taken a permanent leap across the threshold and there was no going back after this. All his life, he’d wanted to be accepted for who he was, by everyone who knew him. But he knew that he would always be seen a circus freak. Cast out by his family, his neighbourhood, and his town, he knew that his only option was to reinvent himself and make the best of whatever life he had left. But he had too much to contend with; living an excruciating charade where he lived as neither man nor woman but a freak show. It was not enough for him to live within a perpetually degrading and unfulfilling drag act; he wanted something he knew he could never have; to actually be a woman and to be accepted as one. And with no success, he pulled this one final stunt. He vowed to conquer and revenge the very sex that had ruined him in the first place, by kidnapping a young girl and humiliating, outperforming… defeminising her. But was it not significant that his old, crippled and neglected body waited for this particular moment to shut down on him? It was just as if he had gone against its wishes. He defiled his own identity as a woman. And now all was lost. Whatever he had that kept him determined to carry on throughout his life… had finally gone. In the faint distance, he heard what sounded like sirens wailing outside. It was time. He opened his old wooden box and pulled out a service revolver, which his father had left to him. He placed the cold metal nose in his mouth. He closed his eyes. Then he heard several raps against the front door upstairs. Regretting his life, he exhaled deep pity and regret for his pathetic life. “Police! Open the door!” Then he pulled the trigger. And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the swan song of “Geraldine” Atkins. * “Shhh…” whispered Annabel. “Here he comes.” Gerald was waltzing proudly through the lounge. Then, he saw Annabel and smiled at her. “Gerald! Come here! Good boy!” Gerald ran as fast as he could. Annabel led her out to the garden and turned towards him. “Gerald… you can’t play with us as long as you’re a boy.” Gerald cheekily smiled with an oblivious look of excitement. “So…” Annabel smirked, “we’re going to turn you into a girl!” Then, out of nowhere, all of Annabel’s friends emerged from behind, jumped him and held him to the ground. Gerald was taken by surprise, and massively uncomfortable. Annabel walked across to the patio and picked up her mother’s terrifying large pair of garden secateurs. “Pull down his pants!” Gerald finally realised what was happening, and began to struggle and scream. But they blocked his mouth with their hands and held him down harder. Once Gerald’s pants were down, and the operation was underway, Annabel advanced slowly towards him, motioning to cut with the giant scissors. Gerald squirmed and fidgeted, and looked to find any trace of humanity in his big sister’s eyes. “Hold still Gerald! This won’t hurt if you sit still!” Then, she opened the blades, lowered them carefully, and proceeded… ... “From now on, your name shall be “Geraldine” Atkins!” At this moment, Mother came into the garden and witnessed everything. She was mortified, and absolutely speechless. She began to felt unwell, and noticeably unhinged by the nightmarish scene in front of her. She immediately ran towards Geraldine and inspected the damage up close… then turned with horror to see the innocent look on Annabel’s face, as she wiped away the blood on her face. “Look, Mummy! I made Gerald into a girl!” ... 3-year-old Geraldine was taken to the local hospital, which did their best to repair the damage, though he fell into a coma, and did not awaken until 3 years later. Once the details of this incident became public, Penelope Atkins was deemed unfit to be a mother and lost custody of her children. She later committed suicide. Once he finally woke up, Geraldine was left in the care of his grandparents, who would scorn and reject him, seeing him as a nothing more than a “mistake”, who would never amount to anything. Living an isolated life, Geraldine found solace in playing the piano. It was the activity he could regularly attend to that distracted him somewhat from his complications, and his life. It took him decades before he finally managed to cultivate his stage personality. Though still not satisfied with the surgery performed on him, he would frequently inject himself with morphine, apply a needle and thread to see if he could finalise his transition into womanhood. But he never succeeded. In death, he died as much as he lived; unsexed, and alone. But in his death, he had sparked even greater curiosity and infamy than he did while he was alive. In the neighbourhood where he lived since, there has been an increase in reports of young local girls aged 15-18, who had mysteriously vanished while walking around the public footpaths. But that’s not all. Local residents have even told vague tales of the faint noise of “piano-playing” and even singing nearby every March, even though the house has since long been abandoned. And the song they reported hearing would always sound like this… “Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain… On the parchment of history ‘tis written O, how our enemies shall soon be smitten Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain!”"}

This time I would like to try to publish another of my stories, this one with a different approach. It is translated from Spanish to English. Synopsis: it is about a theory about Doveland, Wisconsin, about its possible disappearance, through an original story that explores themes of both MK Ultra and technology. It's a bit long, but it's worth it, at least in Spanish I've been told. https://someordinarygamers.fandom.com/wiki/Doveland_Experiment . —Preceding unsigned comment added by ElSable343 ( talk • contribs ). So I recently decided to make a pokemon creepypasta and thought \"Maybe I can get it on the Creepypasta Wiki\". Would you mind looking it over? I put a lot of effort into it. https://pokepasta.fandom.com/wiki/Sudo_Stalker —Preceding unsigned comment added by ChickenNuggy123 ( talk • contribs ). (I'm putting this here, since I originally put it on the wrong spot, apologies) Basically, an attempt at rewriting Sonic.exe I made last year. I got some pretty good response from some members in the community. It's more of a reimagining of the 2017 remake than of the original, as I always saw a lot of wasted potential in that story's style. https://archiveofourown.org/works/33516460/chapters/83274163 Afonso productions ( talk ) 07:43, 8 June 2022 (UTC) OK so, for some reason, the first link didn't work and my appeal got denied, so here is my second attempt, hopefully this doesn't take months like the last one: https://minecraftcreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/The_Minecon_1979_Incident (for some reason trying to change the link's appearance breaks it). Sausagea1000 ( talk ) 09:51, 5 July 2022 (UTC) https://geosheas-lost-episodes.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mysterious_Christmas_Tape I ran it through a grammar checker and fixed the mistakes. Hopefully, it was the run on sentences. I tried my best to make this a good story. It is about myself finding a tape in a box that was not like the others and the horrible truth about it is revealed. Thank you for your time. Brittney A Bosoni ( talk ) Update: The editor on the old link was being a pain and the text kept repeating itself and wouldn't let me get rid of the extra text. So I created a new page with the grammar checker version. Brittney A Bosoni ( talk ) I added the story into Spinpasta and tell me what I got right or wrong.

I just tried to bring something new to the wiki. i also worked hard on making this creepypasta so please don’t delete my creepypasta. —Preceding unsigned comment added by SomethingRelatible ( talk • contribs ). This page got randomly hit with a spin-off notice and I don’t know why. If it is a spin-off, then it’s pure coincidence, because I meant for this story to be original. I just can’t why it’s slapped with a spin-off and deletion notice. I created the story months ago, but posted it here recently. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Unknwon1000 ( talk • contribs ). I am not pleased that my story I have worked so hard on is getting deleted from the wiki. If you look at the page right now, I have literally spent so much time working on it. It's about a rare prototype WrestleMania event that was held back in '84. I disagree with this decision to delete the page. I put so much effort into making sure this story was good as well as a fairly long and decent pasta, but now all of that is getting Thanos-snapped out of existence. I have proof-read, I have made sure it was at least passable. I typed for hours to make sure this story was good. And it's getting deleted for being a \"Spinoff\". How many times am I going to make these things only for them to be deleted? I spent way too much time on this and I am just not going to let all of this hard work go to waste. I really want to participate on this website, but stuff like this actively discourages me from participating. I am trying to hold back my emotions as much as possible, because I whole-heartedly feel that my hard work should not just be thrown into the trash. If you still disagree with me and still feel this shouldn't be allowed to be posted, I want a good, long explanation why. I do not want a short brief reason split into bullet points. I want a good, reasonable reason that is long and detailed. Seriously, look at the page right now before it is deleted. Look at all of the hard work I put into it! I put my heart and soul into this and its getting deleted for this. If this cannot be resolved through this, and you end up denying it, give me a good reason with a long explanation. I made sure this followed all the rules, this didn't have too many cliches, and tried to make it as decent as possible. Actual effort was put in, and it's just getting nuked out of existence! If you end up denying this, I need a good reason, with a good explanation that is long and in-depth. Cause right now I am very disappointed with this ruling, and I want someone to take a second look at this.

Hello, my name is FoxRose07. This story is basically about a clerk accidently selling a guy who wanted to buy Sonic Unleashed a cursed version of the game and the guy who buys it and get himself and the clerk dead when he realizes weird things about the game and is at GameStop to return. https://pastebin.com/cxkQBVWn —Preceding unsigned comment added by FoxRose2007 ( talk • contribs ). I feel like the main reason my story was deleted was because it was a spin off but I wanted to see if it could have another chance, so here you go. A story about remembrance, a creepy puffball, and an adventure. I tried my best to make a good, original plot with as little cliche's as possible, this is my first time writing a creepypasta and I really put a lot of work into this. Please give this another chance. (Also just to make one thing clear this is NOT an EXE story) https://pastebin.com/t6fxKaaR —Preceding unsigned comment added by CorruptedData42 ( talk • contribs ).

I didn't know there was a ruleset against cartoon or video game pastas before posting it. I would've used Pastebin to post this, but it kept telling me that it detected offensive content, and I really don't want to post on the Spinpasta wiki as that site is pretty much run down with terrible stories now. https://lostepisodecreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Earneck —Preceding unsigned comment added by ChenArchive ( talk • contribs ). Hello, admins and mods! I have just gotten my lost episode story deleted per the spinoff policy. I hope that you can re-consider your decision to get rid of my story. The plot revolves around Butters Stotch getting into a therapist conversation with a man named Mr. BINT, who is later revealed to just be Butter's Inner Thoughts: Here is the Spinpasta link for you guys to look at!: https://spinpasta.fandom.com/wiki/Get_It_Out_Butters —Preceding unsigned comment added by MaestroMyles ( talk • contribs ).

It's based off of an obscure anime by the name of Nekojiru, which involves a lot of racism (against pig people) and violence. I thought I'd write a story about it from the mind of one of the main characters. To put it simply, Nyako discusses her experiences with segregation in this world of common house animals and people, before discussing how she feels about pigs. Eventually, she does something to a pig that she may never forget. https://lostepisodecreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Apartheid ChenArchive ( talk ) 01:45, 1 February 2024 (UTC) A collaborative effort I did with DJ Sprouts involving an early build of DDLC, connecting back to someone the creator of the game used to know.

I noticed that the last story I submitted didn't fit within the wiki as it felt more like a feelspasta, so I thought I'd post this one instead. Summary is that Yuri comes home after a bad day of school, and attempts to write her words on paper, but a certain someone ends up invading her thoughts. https://lostepisodecreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Poem_by_Yuri ChenArchive ( talk ) 05:50, 20 February 2024 (UTC) A rewrite of SpongeBob Bootleg Episode, involving some form of mystery.

If this does end up getting accepted, I would like to post it myself as like Ditched, this is a rewrite of someone else's story, and I would like to give credit to all the people involved with the help. If there are tense issues with the grammar, I will gladly fix those before uploading as well.

Whoever's reviewing this might remember me and my status on the Lost Episode Wiki, but that's not relevant, what is relevant however is that this story is based on what we believe to be one of the first stories uploaded to our site almost 11 years ago, \"Wubbzysuicide666.win,\" which itself, is just a ripoff of Max and Ruby 004. So, when Chen Archive decided to run a little writing contest to see if people could adapt the (regrettably) historic Wubbzypasta, I decided to throw my hat in the ring, this is the result of that effort. Enjoy, or don't, I dunno, I think this one's a keeper at least. https://lostepisodecreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Wubbzy:_Prince_in_Yellow DJ Sprouts ( talk ) 07:33, 20 April 2024 (UTC) A lost episode-styled pasta about an educational pitch pilot created by the protagonist. It ends up getting sabotaged in the test group showing by someone he knows, and family issues ensue. Main reason I put this in the Spinoff Appeal is because I wanted to see what the admins thought of it. A reviewer on YouTube gave it a 10/10, which I appreciate, but it's nice to get a second opinion from people who write non-spinoff stuff. Also, I'm ChenArchive, I just go by a different Fandom username now. https://lostepisodecreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Penelope%27s_Park LafawndaPasta ( talk ) 01:13, 22 May 2024 (UTC) I have seen a SM64 creepypasta that was extremely sick (good written), so I wanted to upload it in this wiki translated to English (the original language is Spanish). The problem is that the original used many \"invalid characters\" as in: (), \", and !. The next problem being because of the content this creepypasta has, it may not be suitable for this wiki, but allowed in the Spanish wiki. The creepypasta I'm talking about it's called \"Versión Perversa de Mario 64\": https://creepypasta.fandom.com/es/wiki/Versi%C3%B3n_Perversa_De_Mario_64 A My Little Pony shortpasta that isn't about a lost episode or the toys themselves.

As such, it exists in the public domain and is for entertainment purposes only. It should be read with the original post and the accompanying Youtube video in mind and is not stand alone. I thank you for your time. https://www.deviantart.com/charrennes/art/1096913599 —Preceding unsigned comment added by DARK DEMENTUS ( talk • contribs ). Hi there! This may be atypical for what this site is for, but I think it's worth trying to get it on here anyway. This is an actual story that happened to me... that I'm putting up on places like this wiki. I should also say that both halves of it are important to include if you decide to put it on the site. I'm very aware of how the story sounds similar to many stories put on this site. That's part of why I think that it should be on it all. https://pokepasta.fandom.com/wiki/HEART_AND_SOUL AmbientRainfall ( talk ) 21:14, 21 October 2024 (UTC) This is a creepypasta I wrote that's based on the Friday Night Funkin song, Shucks, alongside the Super Mario Logan video, The Secret Door, as goofy as that may sound. It's about Marvin's wife, Rose, and his son, Jeffry, going missing after an argument they had. Marvin searches the house, fails to find them, and eventually discovers a door in one of the side rooms that wasn't there before. When he opens the door, he not only finds his family, but also uncovers something he defiantly wasn't meant to see.

This is a new SpongeBob creepypasta I created meant to be similar in style to the likes of Plankton Got Served, but with more polish and existential symbolism. It’s a story about a newly discovered DVD containing an episode titled “Lina”. It and the events leading up to it are a bizarre artistic projection of a man who murdered his fiancée and suffered immense regret. I promise it’s not haunted or anything lol You can read the whole story here: https://lostepisodecreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Krusty_Kronicles JacksonKlo ( talk ) 03:41, 30 January 2025 (UTC) So, decided to take a stab at doing something like this. Synopsis: A man who was indifferent towards dating decides to attend a speed date and meets an exceptionally beautiful young woman. However, as he slowly starts to realize, there is something sinister to her and how she might not be human. Essentially my rewrite of Dating Game just without the narrator whining about being in his 30s and thought being single was as bad as being a schizophrenic and without some of the detailed kills. And leaning more towards the supernatural than the original.

A pokepasta about a veteran player who decides to revisit Pokemon Red and stumbles upon some unexpected glitches. https://pokepasta.fandom.com/wiki/Verzephobia LostAndFoundSilver ( talk ) 2:25, 14 Mar 2025 (UTC) Based on sketchy Mario flash games from back in the game. The story revolves around Mario fan game called Detective Mario where the player helps Mario in cracking secrets. When you 100% the game and enter a previously unenterable house in game however, a secret final case unlocks. While the pasta on surface level paints Mario as a killer cleaning up evidence of his crime, if you pay attention to details, you'll find the truth of what really happened. Story link --- https://lostepisodecreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Paradise —Preceding unsigned comment added by GardenFlower ( talk • contribs ). Basic synopsis: The original creepypasta falls into typical clichés common of the time—especially those not limited to just “lost episodes.” While a tired subject nowadays, I believed it had the potential for genuine refinement. I wanted to try my own approach at rewriting the story from the ground up. This version is less about shock, gore, or disturbing imagery, and instead focuses on tragedy, loss, and love. Think of it as similar in tone to vibingleaf’s excellent Red Mist Re-take. The original story, in my opinion, struggled because everything happened without context. I worked hard to provide clear reasons why the events unfold as they do and to shift the tone away from pure shock toward something more human and empathetic. It’s not just, “AND THEN THERE’S BLOOD AND EVERYONE DIES BUT THEN MAX STARES AT THE CAMERA.” No one wants to read that. This is a genuine rewrite intended to bring the concept up to modern standards. I’m a first-time pasta writer. I fully expect this to be denied, but I wanted to try anyway.

Shortcuts: CP:SO CP:NMS Due to the excessive similarity and general lack of quality of these types of stories, and the fact that the community at large is fed up with them, we no longer accept spinoffs, sequels, prequels, knockoffs, fanfics, or stories about creepypasta entities of any kind that the author didn't create, as well as stories based on existing intellectual properties (television shows, movies, video games). This includes, but is in no way limited to, Lost Silver , Pokémon Black , Slenderman , The Rake , Sonic.exe , Tails Doll , Snow on Mt. Silver , BOB , Squidward's Suicide / Red Mist , Happy Appy , BEN , Normal Porn for Normal People , Dogscape , Abandoned by Disney , The Russian Sleep Experiment , The Theater , The Smiling Man , Moon Face , Candle Cove , Eyeless Jack , Dead Bart , Smile Dog , Herobrine , Zalgo , Jeff the Killer , the Holders series , etc. Making spinoffs of existing spinoffs, like Slenderman vlogs, is also forbidden. So are more recent characters/memes such as Siren Head , Momo , and The Backrooms . Generic beings such as wendigos/skinwalkers are fine, just not specific named characters. Blacklisted subjects Listed below are additional blacklisted subjects that have been banned since this rule's creation. While they don't count as spinoffs per sé, it's generally agreed-upon that most of them are essentially bad rehashes/carbon copies of more successful pastas. They contain themes, elements, and formulas that are, for one reason or another, heavily overused, and used poorly . No more MLP grimdark fics. These count as fanfiction. Try writing a pasta about (gasp) the figurines themselves instead. No SCP pages. Stories inspired by SCP are allowed as long as they don't follow the SCP formula too closely. No lost episode pastas, or any stories centered on real shows or movies. Fictitious or generic shows (e.g. \"the news\" or \"a soccer game\") are still allowed, obviously. No OC fact sheet pages. Jeff-\"inspired\" stories now count as Jeff spinoffs and will be deleted accordingly. See this page for further information. No more \"theory\" pastas for specific movies, TV shows, or videogames. You can still post \"theories\" about film, television, and media in general, but not about specific shows, games, or characters. REGARDING VIDEO GAME STORIES: No .exe or \"haunted file\" style pastas. They're overdone and just not scary anymore. The previous blanket ban on \"haunted gaming\" stories was rescinded in 2019. However, cliched video game pastas of any kind are still banned. See this blog post for more information. Cleverbot pastas/blog posts have been forbidden for a while, but posting one is now a bannable offense. You CANNOT get around these rules by posting stories on forbidden subjects (that is, the content itself, not offsite links) in blog posts, forums, Discussions, your userpage, or your Talk page. Abuse Filter In addition to the blacklisted subjects listed above, some pastas are automatically disallowed by our Abuse Filter. The Abuse Filter searches for certain key words and phrases in every new pasta and stops the page from being created if it finds them. There are two filters: the Title Blacklist and the Content Blacklist . The Title Blacklist blocks pages based on what is contained in the title while the Content Blacklist blocks pages based on what is contained in the page itself. Title Blacklist: jeff, slenderman, slendy, sanic, pokemon, mlp, Suicidemouse, spongebob, cleverbot, funnymouth, squidward, roblox, minecraft, herobrine, scp, happy appy, candle cove, dead bart, smiledog, zalgo, ben, tails doll, brvr, animal crossing, lavender town, swords and potions, teh, spooderman, land before time, tf2, half life, call of duty, super smash, bad fur day, fluttershy, childrens hospital, the killer, fazbear, grifter, masky Content Blacklist: pokemon, slendy, slenderman, zelda, megaman, mario, luigi, fallout 3, minecraft, fazbear, roblox There is also a third filter, the Special Characters Blacklist . It blocks pages which contain special characters in the title. If you are affected by this filter, try to publish your page with no punctuation in the title, then ask an administrator or rollbacker to rename it for you. Where else can I post spinoffs? Alternative sites include Pastebin , DeviantART , and the Spinpasta Wiki . Again, if you're confident in your writing abilities and think your spinoff is good enough to be included on this wiki, try Spinoff Appeal . But what about Squidward's Suicide ? Many historical pastas such as Squidward's Suicide, BEN Drowned, Dead Bart, etc. stand on this wiki as a testament to their place as progenitors of their respective tropes. While once considered fresh and creepy, their popularity has inspired legions of poor quality stories based on existing forms of media, which is why we have these rules in place. Disclaimer In the event you post via any means a story, page, or blog post about a subject matter that is determined, at an admin's discretion, to be 1) in a highly clichéd genre/category/subject and 2) poorly written, clichéd, generic, or of generally poor quality, then the admins are free at their discretion to delete the page at any time without warning.

The cool", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Diary/Journal", "Space", "Nature", "Lovecraftian"], "content": "I’ve decided to begin keeping a journal on the progress of the colony. I don’t know why, I suppose I just want a place to compile all my thoughts. So far the name of the planet has been fitting enough, PARADISE-9 appears to have an abundance of resources, and the oxygen has proven to be a perfect replica of earths. The farmers have started planting their crops, but only time will show if their efforts wield the desired results. We’ve made contact with a few alien species, sadly they appear to only have a primal level of intelligence, more akin to a common pig or cow than a human. A few of the other colonists are planning to explore the planet a bit more tomorrow. I think I’m going to join them. Unfortunately, the trip has been uneventful so far. The wilderness has been more of the same, large titanic forests surrounded by lush undergrowth. The cool, sticky air clung to our jumpsuits while we traversed through the planets landscape. This planet feels so similar, yet alien. Untouched by society, I wonder if earth once looked like this? We stumbled across a pond towards the end of the day, it was a murky colour with algae and several fallen branches floating on it. On the opposite end of the pond stood a large creature drinking the water, similar in shape to a deer, though its fur was a deep black and its antlers held more resemblance to a goat’s horns than a deer’s antlers. It was mesmerizing. It raises a question though, if there are prey, how come we haven’t come across any predators? The others have fallen asleep, were going to continue exploring in the morning. I’m going to try and get some shuteye. Ill report our findings next time I get a chance. Strange findings. Early in the morning we came across an odd sight. We came across a rather large waterfall, a brilliant blue colour. The rushing water sparkled with life. A couple meters away from the waterfall stood a sight which stopped all of us in our tracks. There was a campsite. There was a campsite. It appeared tribal, the tents were made of leather and cordage with a large fire pit in the center of the site. From our position it looked empty, still we approached with caution. Upon closer inspection the campsite was ancient, vines and roots had intertwined with the tents and the fire pit appeared to not have been lit in centuries. I opened the flap to one of the tents but found no one. As was the case for the rest of the tents. Some of the others decided to stay behind for a bit to study the site. Splitting our group in half. The rest of the day passed without incident, for the most part. Halfway through the day, I started catching whiffs of a strange scent. It was sickeningly sweet, combined with the smell of rotten fish. It was incredibly pungent and only grew stronger as the day went on. Its dusk now as I write this, the air is unpleasantly warm. I keep thinking back to that campsite, what was it doing there, and what happened to its occupants? I must’ve fallen asleep last night because when I woke up Fritz was gone. We looked for hours but we couldn’t find him. We couldn’t even find footprints. The forest looks less pleasant than before, the trees are dead and the shadows dance around us mockingly. His girlfriend, Sasha is devastated. Her sobs echo throughout the dead forest. We’ve decided to go back to the colony, I know I’ve had enough of exploring this planet. The stench is still there, I don’t know what to make of all this. My head is so muddled, I can’t think straight. I’ll report back by the end of the day. On the way back, we stopped at the campsite. The colonists that stayed behind were gone. But I hardly noticed due to the change in the landscape. The waterfall was murky, green and bubbling. A far cry from the beautiful cataract that it once was. The air felt oppressive and polluted, the feeling was only strengthened by the pungent stench that now completely enveloped my senses. After searching the area for a few moments with no results, we ultimately decided that the others must have already left for the colony. I, however, was skeptical. There were no footprints leading from the site and the sleeping bags that they were presumably staying in hadn’t been packed up. Everyone was anxious to go, but I wanted to check the place out further. I was investigating one of the sleeping bags when I noticed it. It was a small fissure in the earth, roots and vines sprawled out of it. I put my face closer to it, inches away from the crack in the coarse ground. After a moment of scrutinizing the crevice I noticed something. Deep inside the fissure a face stared at me. Yeah, a goddamn face. The worst part is that I recognized her. Maya, I believe her name was. Roots intertwined with her rough, dirty face. She attempted to cry out, but the roots appeared to be strangling her, dragging her into the depths. Her crystal eyes silently pleaded with me, but I couldn’t save her. The fissure closed up, leaving no trace. The moment was gone as if it never happened. I haven’t told anyone about what happened, for I fear that they’ll think me mad. They can tell somethings wrong with me though. We’ve set up camp a few miles out from the site. It’ll be a day’s walk to get back to the colony in the morning. The smell is absolutely overpowering me now, I don’t know how the others have gotten any sleep at all. We started this journey with 12 people, now we have 5. Ill report my findings next time I get a chance. I saw it happen this time. It was very late last night when it happened. I was leaning against a nearby tree when I saw a fissure erupt from the ground near Gerald. Roots slowly crept from the crevice, making their way towards him. The roots surrounded Gerald, tightening around him. His eyes flipped open, but it was too late for him. The roots violently brought him back into the hole, thrashing against his weight. I snapped myself out of the daze I was in and sprang into action. I tried to hold onto him, but the roots tore him away from my grasp. I cried out, waking the others up. There was panic, screaming and all the while we struggled against the roots in an attempt to save Gerald’s life. The roots overpowered us, dragging him into the fissure before promptly closing up. We’ve decided not to rest again until we reach the colony. I’ll update the journal once we reach home. Hopefully I have some good news for a change. I’ve found this planet to be exceedingly cruel. It was dusk when we reached the colony. The crops were dead, the people gone. Roots surrounded the buildings. The shuttle that brought us here was sunken into the ground, held down by roots and vines. We decided to search inside for some provisions. The inside of the buildings was a wreck. Peoples belongings were strewn about the place, there were cracks in the floor every few steps. By the time we finished up it was night time. We had ten days’ worth of rations, six days’ worth of water, a pistol with nine shots, a couple of flashlights with spare batteries and a tinder bundle. Lisa wanted to stay here to try and get the ship working. Everyone else wanted to try our luck in the wilds, that place wasn’t safe. Unfortunately, we couldn’t convince her to come with us. Its sunrise now, we’ve been trudging through this planet nonstop for several hours. We’re taking a break for a few moments so I’m using the opportunity to write this entry. Paul had an interesting idea, we might try it tonight. Well that could’ve gone better. The idea was that we would sleep in the branches of a tree for the night. Our logic was that it can’t get us if were up high enough. I was assigned with keeping watch for the first half of the night. Things were fine until a few hours into my shift, when I was having trouble maintaining consciousness. It was 1:37 AM when I finally succumbed to my need for sleep. I woke up to Sasha pushing me awake, her eyes were wide, and she looked like she was on the verge of tears. She pointed towards the end of the branch where Paul was sitting, that’s when I saw it. Paul was being devoured by the tree. The lower half of his body was already enveloped by the thing. I wondered why he wasn’t calling out until I saw it. A branch was sticking out of his mouth. It must’ve been growing throughout all his body, he writhed in agony, trying to scream, trying to be heard. We decided to end his suffering. The sound of the shot rang out for miles. I watched as the branch in his body slowly withered away, his body returned to flesh and he dropped from the tree with a sickening crunch. We decided to burn him, I don’t trust this planet enough for a proper burial. Me and Sasha both decided to avoid trees from now on. I never liked Paul that much, but I still feel a strong sense of loss. He was one of the few people left on this godforsaken planet. I wonder what happened to the others? What does this place need us for? I discovered something odd today. We were starting a fire to warm ourselves up when I had a peculiar idea. I grabbed a nearby stick that was laying in the dead grass and set it alight. I brought the flaming stick towards a tree, it seemingly shriveled up the closer the flame got. The moment my makeshift torch hit the tree it ignited like it was doused in gasoline. The heat was so intense that I had to take several steps back. The fire danced and licked the tree, spreading and soaring. I was quite proud of myself. Until I heard the roar. It was a primal cry, one of defiance and desperation. The flaming tree cracked and groaned as it split into several parts. From those parts emerged humanoid beings made from wood, they were alight and made contorted movements. Every step they made seemed pained and deliberate. I shouted at Sasha for the gun as I slowly backed away. She fired at one of them, landing a shot in what I presume to be the head, pieces of burning wood chipped off as it fell to the ground. A second shot hit one of them in chest, staggering it back momentarily. The third one reached me, it grabbed my arm, burning me. I shoved my flaming stick through its forehead, I heard the sound of wood splintering apart. A third shot ended the second creature. As I impaled the third one’s head all the way through. I don’t know what happened, we packed up immediately. We traveled for a few hours before finding a place to rest again. Fear the earth lest it devour you whole, fear the trees for they hold secrets that you’ll never know. I’m all alone now. I don’t know if it was because of the loneliness, the fear, the knowledge that our rations are running low, or just the tiredness. But I guess she couldn’t take it anymore. I decided to burn her body. She wouldn’t have wanted it to be taken. We never talked much, even when it was just the two of us, but I felt close to her. I thought about joining her, but I don’t really see the point. Maybe I’ll be rescued eventually and get off this horrible planet. But until then, I’ve decided to keep going This planet is getting restless, I can feel it, and I don’t know how much longer it’s going to wait. I’m so tired. I haven’t slept in days and I’m out of supplies. The water is poison. The plants are inedible. The meat of any animals I manage to kill rot within seconds. I think I’ve figured out why this place doesn’t have any predators. It’s because this place IS a predator. It lures people like us in with its bountiful resources and lush landscape, and when our guard is down, it goes in for the kill. I hate this place. It was supposed to be a paradise, not a graveyard. My only hope is that someone finds this journal and gets out before it’s too late. At this point, I just want to know what awaits me deep below the ground. Will it just eat me? Or is there something more? I found a nice spot to lie down for a while. I wonder if I’ll see the others when I’m down there?"}

I’m sorry to say that this isn’t one of those. It all started I guess ‘once upon a Thursday morning, February, 2018. I’ll never forget that day, or the days that followed. I was a proud and easy-going father of two beautiful girls at the time, Hannah, 8, and Chloe, 7. As the manager for a diner now derelict and dead, I was what you might call a ‘workaholic’. My wife, Cindy, was the one who spent the most time with our daughters, and I was always the distant one in the family, never having enough time to spare other than the weekends and, well, now. Fortunately, my staff and co-workers were always there to support me when she couldn’t, being a carer who was well-used to dealing with lonely, tired and often stressed people. I loved my job, but I loved my daughters more than life itself. Despite my efforts, the place wasn’t as popular anymore, with new food chains and restaurants opening everywhere in Topeka, Kansas, stealing away many of our former diners. We knew we wouldn’t have long left, so my efforts slowed down and I started to collect my earnings, dreading the day of closure upon us. But there was an upside-I didn’t always have to spend as much time working there, meaning I could finally and fully prepare for the first time, in advance, for Hannah’s birthday on the 15th. Prior to the diner’s dying days, Cindy would have to suggest a present she found herself and I’d purchase it, but I never got to pick out something for their birthdays. I was so irresponsible, so lazy and so pathetic, that I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to finally decide for myself what my little girl would open up on that morning. Something I’d chosen. Something she’d love and adore. When I arrived at the toy store on the Monday afternoon, with little time to choose and hide it from prying eyes, my attention almost immediately drifted to something in one of the corner stalls. It wasn’t a huge place, but an ordinary, dimly lit, traditional toy store clustered with LEGO sets, stuffed animals, plastic guns and swords, action figures, dolls etc. But that glistening golden bottle, sitting tucked away in the far right corner of the shop behind a shiny jack-in-the-box and a Jenga set (the place wasn’t well-organized), caught my eye. With the shop bustling with fellow parents and some toddlers, I didn’t hesitate to stride over and pull out the gleaming flask. On the front, in a sparkly, spiral, neon pink font was written ‘The Amazing Elixir’ on a crimson-red sticker, surrounded by silver sequins and a tagline ‘helpfully heals and carefully cures’, but no other text other than another sticker saying ‘Suitable for all ages’ and a clarification that it came as part of a ‘brewing set’, presumably for kids. What had struck me as odd wasn’t just the absence of any company name or logo, and the contents being nothing more than what seemed to be water filled with golden spheres, was the absence of any packaging information or ingredients. There was no indication as to whether it was consumable or not, just blemishes of random text on the back such as ‘curs’ and ‘ference’. Focus , I’d said to myself, won’t be here long ...It was apparently part of a ‘potion-brewing set for young witches and wizards’. Hannah loved magic, witches and even chemistry at an early age, and there was little else in the store I could see through the crowds as I glanced around hoping to find something more legitimate in time. I was desperate to get my hands on whatever I could as quick as possible. Intrigued, I’d asked the elderly, heavily tanned shopkeeper about the product. “Ahem-apologies sir, but there doesn’t appear to be any such brewing set that you described” he coughed out with a tone of mock sympathy. “I did, however, find a children’s cauldron and chemis-oh...sorry, alchemy set that bears some resemblance to what you asked for”. “That’ll do. It’s fine-as long as it’s in good condition, that’s all I care about. I’m just curious as to why there’s no ingredients information on the bottle.” I asked sternly, steering the subject towards the mysterious nature of the ‘toy’. “Would you mind if I take a quick-” “Yes, yes, yes-just please don’t be long. I’m in a bit of a hurry.” I answered impatiently. A quick glance at my watch affirmed I didn’t have much time. The girls would be home soon from school. I noticed the golden figure’s eye’s twitch as he glanced lazily over the back of the bottle, as though something brushed against his face, blurting out several more coughs. The bored expression he maintained changed briefly to what may have been a toothy grin to himself that spread across his faintly golden face, but I doubted anything was wrong with the product-he didn’t seem concerned, so I didn’t feel as though I ought to be either; he did, however, seem to unscrew the cork on the top and take a small sip of the liquid before murmuring something to himself, something I couldn’t make out; the language didn’t seem familiar from what I’d picked up from staff, customers, school and TV. But I didn’t want to make a fuss. Nutter’s probably just testing it...Just clean it when you get home I thought, Hannah won’t notice . “Everything seems fine to me,” he wheezed. “It looks like it’s been here a while. We take in all sorts of stuff, you know. The info’s probably just faded away over time. Just to be safe, I’d recommend using just what comes with this kit. Better to be safe than sorry!” He shoved the vial, a small, matte black cauldron and a brightly coloured box of ‘Cool Chemicals and Crazy Compounds!’ into a plastic bag. “Thanks” I mumbled absent-mindedly as I scurried out of the store, the wheezing coughs of the shopkeeper drowned out by the crowds. I didn’t have time for that old guy to prattle on any further, even if he was finished giving advice. I couldn’t miss this opportunity. I needed to see the look on my daughter’s face of joy and delight from me, and to overcome the jealousy I’d always harboured for Cindy. I would be just as responsible as her . I felt I needed to prove it to not just her, but my girls as well. Finally the big day came, with my gift having been carefully wrapped and hidden behind my bedside table, bearing a smug grin across my face as I looked back at my wife, just starting to wake up on that chilly morning. I’d wrapped each present neatly, including the cauldron and the chemistry set (taken out of the box to not ruin the illusion), with ‘The Amazing Elixir’ wrapped separately, hidden near the bottom of the gift bag. I could hear Hannah’s high pitched squeals as she dashed down stairs with a yawning Chloe, and again in response to the sight of the presents we laid out all over the floor the evening prior. Cindy and I exchanged satisfied looks as we joined them downstairs by the sofa, Chloe slumping on the armchair and Hannah in the centre, wide-eyed. “Would you like to open ours first Hannah? Mom and I-” “‘Put a lot of time and effort into getting these’, yes I know Dad.” She responded with a smile. I edged closer to her than Cindy, surprised at my proactive behaviour, and handed Hannah the bag. She loved the cauldron, she liked the chemistry set but her reaction to the supplementary present was quite odd. The bottle sat in her palms, the label shimmering in the sunlight, as she held it close to her face, acting unusually inquisitive. Overly-curious, I guess you could say. Wasn’t too weird, but I was just worried she didn’t like it. “Do you like everything, sweetie? Is everything alright?” I asked, noticing Cindy’s anxious look. No response. Hannah just sat there, staring at it. It wasn’t like her at all. She was always very grateful from a very young age, and to see her almost glazing over was disturbing. Her hand was shaking as she held it, with a weak, dreamy grin plastered on her face. Then I’d noticed Hannah starting to unscrew the cork, her pupils fixed on the watery liquid inside. “Hannah, don’t drink it honey! It’ll make you very, very sick! Just put the top back on...” Cindy warned. Hannah had taken no notice of her pleas, and after removing the cork, started to tip the contents onto her lips and into her mouth, and we lunged forwards. I ran her mouth under the tap, as Cindy softly scolded Hannah, as though she were a kitten who’d scratched a guest. There was no trace of the liquid, and I prayed to God she hadn’t swallowed any of it. Maybe she just didn’t hear her properly . I thought. She’s tried to eat clay before. Kids often do crap like this. It’s just Hannah being Hannah. Hannah was fine for the rest of the day, and when we asked her about it, she just mumbled something about not hearing Cindy, and we responded naturally by reminding her not to lie. She wouldn’t speak clearly, as though she feared telling the truth like she would get in trouble. “We’re not angry with you,” I insisted to her sulking face “We’re just trying to keep you safe and healthy, okay? Tell us when you’re using it, and we’ll make sure it’s safe, okay Hannah?” She nodded. Cindy kept the bottle on her bedside cabinet for the rest of the day, so I was obviously startled in the morning to find it in Chloe’s the next morning while cleaning up. It was just over half empty. We immediately confronted Chloe, who behaved exactly as Hannah had-defensive, quiet and refusing to give us a straight answer as to why it was half empty. Cindy rushed the two to the doctors, fearing they’d drank their share of the stuff, with the two having the convenient habit of sharing things with each other, which wasn’t as admirable as it was before. Cindy came home with the two, letting of little more than a sigh of relief and an expression of severe tiredness. I wasn’t satisfied with this. “Hannah, come here.” I said, anger in my voice as I raised the flask to her innocent face. She had looked so confused, and understandably so-I’d never had to raise my voice like this to her. “Hannah, listen to me very carefully-do not drink this. Don’t start dragging Chloe into this either! Stop it, alright! You’re a big girl now, an-“ “But Dad, I c-couldn’t help it. I was th-thirsty. My throat was s-so dry. I had to d-drink it, Dad. I h-had to. Pleas-” she whimpered. “ENOUGH HANNAH!” Cindy screamed. “STOP LYING TO US! This isn’t like you! You’re a good girl!” And with that, Hannah had dashed upstairs, crying softly. Chloe had sat silently in the armchair, head in her hands. Cindy took the bottle, and put it high on the furthest kitchen shelf in the corner, above their nimble fingers, and then stormed out. She’d left me, standing there, gazing at the flashing flask. I remember being nervous, fearful for my family. The shopkeeper, he took a sip too, I nearly took a sip and they drank half the damn bottle I thought. I’d attempted that Friday after work to try and research about ‘The Amazing Elixir’ product, and found nothing useful but the definition as some sort of ‘magical medicine’, so I reasoned as a product clearly marketed for children it wouldn’t be too harmful, especially with such a title, but I still had my doubts. Cindy reassured me that night that the doctor found that there were no ‘serious symptoms’ he’d observed, but had recommended another check-up on the Saturday morning since he’s noticed their throats were unusually dry, Cindy commenting that they had dry coughs all the way home until she stopped to buy drinks that they accepted eagerly. I stayed awake nearly all night, checking on Chloe and Hannah constantly, listening for coughs, but none came. I shouldn’t have been so impulsive buying that crap. Damn stupid. So stupid and irresponsible. I’d returned to the kitchen for a coffee, when my eyes again drifted to the vial hiding on top of the mahogany shelf. It was mesmerising; the sparkles of light reflecting of the sequins and globes of gold shining in the darkness. I’d felt it again, that night. That urge, the craving to drink it, like I somehow became certain it was the most thirst-quenching, delicious, tastiest liquid that I needed as much as air. Drink it. I’d remembered brushing it off, trying to think clearly, but all I could think about was the concoction that almost seemed to bubble as I edged nearer. Just a sip. It was in my hand, the neon font contrasting against the dull peach of my skin in the dimly lit room. Drink it. I was unscrewing the cork, and I raised it to my lips, tipping the bottle. Drink it all. The taste was unimaginable-sour and sweet and bitter, then sour again. It felt runny like treacle, yet not sticky and thicker than water. I felt 'quenched', yet still thirsty. It was so addictive, and I was so thirsty . “D-Dad? W-What are you doing?” said a small, hoarse voice. Hannah’s voice, yet not like hers at all. In the doorway I saw Hannah. Despite the dim light, I noticed something wasn’t right about her. Hannah’s normally tanned skin was darker, but seemingly shinier. Her face and hands were golden and wrinkled. “H-Hannah?” I whispered. “H-Honey? Are you alright? I d-don’t...” said another voice. Cindy’s voice, but not as warm or motherly. It sounded painful, but most of all, very, very dry. My face contorted into one of fear as I saw too that my wife was also aged and golden. She wasn’t as bad as Hannah, or Chloe, who I’d noticed was lurking behind Cindy, groggy and the doppelgänger of her sister. The girls looked like they’d been deep-fried, while my wife looked like she was covered head to toe in yellowish-orange paint. We had stood there silent for what had felt like hours before Cindy slowly took the bottle and placed it back again on the top shelf. As she walked past the kitchen mirror with the girls in tow, I’d noticed at that moment that none of their reflections bared the wrinkly golden skin, and they never seemed to question their noticeably slower walking speeds, especially for the girls. Saturday morning had arrived and I was stunned to discover the bottle by my bedside, now nearly empty. Swear she left it on the shelf I thought. I had struggled to sit up and jumped at the sight of my own hands, which were as sagging and old as my wife’s. I heard footsteps thump downstairs before an eye-piercing cry of terror fully woke me. As I tried to race down the stairs I’d groaned in agony as my spine ached, but I continued and let out a dry cough. On the living room floor was Cindy crouched over the bodies of Hannah and Chloe, all three of them coughing heartily, with blank eyes and expressions. Cindy had screamed for me to call an ambulance, us both fearing the worst, which I did without hesitation. By the time they arrived, they started wheezing in between coughs. They were laid in beds at the local hospital with respirators, the doctors and nurses alarmed by their skin, as well as Cindy’s, and mine... It’s been two days since Saturday the 17th and they’re still there, the doctors still trying to diagnose an exact illness, baffled by the series of symptoms they’ve developed and the effects on their ‘osmoregulatory system’ and whether it’s a single disease or a combination. Me and Cindy fear for our lives almost as much as theirs, since we too are told we look like our daughters, but not in the normal complimentary way. The bottle’s vanished too-no idea where it’s gone. I’m watching over them in their ward, and I know it won’t be long before I’ll be in a similar position. As I briefly look away, I catch a glimpse of a familiar face-the shopkeeper, walking down the furthest corridor. He turns to look at me, and I gasp in horror. This isn’t the shopkeeper I’d met on Thursday. His skin is a perfect peach and pristine, giving off a more youthful image, but his identity still remained. No coughing. No wheezing. Nothing. He’s...younger. As the truth dawns on me, he gives me a sinister smile, baring chalk-white teeth and a flicker of light in his eyes, before walking calmly off, out of sight.

Back aching", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Disappearances", "Mental Illness", "Places", "Weird"], "content": "It was July 19 th , 1978 when a lonely, middle-aged woman named Meredith moved into 728 West Grove Avenue. Meredith had just lost her husband to cancer, a kind man to whom she had been married to for 27 years. She had no children; her only remaining family was a sister who lived in St. Petersburg, Florida, more than 1,000 miles away from the old house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. So Meredith was all alone, a broken woman, in her new, very old house. The only company she had on the first day of her new life was her young neighbor, Mrs. Anders, and her two children, a five year old boy named Carter and his eight year old sister, Jenna. They had decided to welcome her to the neighborhood with some freshly baked cookies. Meredith didn’t have the heart to tell Mrs. Anders that she had diabetes. It was only after Meredith began unpacking her collection of porcelain dolls that she began to notice some strange happenings within the shabby old house. Back aching, she noticed that a couple of her dolls had been turned around. She thought nothing of it; a wind or a careless arm could’ve done it. But then one day, while Meredith was coming up from the dark, moldy basement, she heard the distinct sound of porcelain shattering against hardwood. She ran upstairs to the little shelves where her dolls were so lovingly placed, only to find that the very first doll she'd ever bought, a beautiful, Russian-style girl with long dark hair, was in smithereens on the floor. Meredith was more sad than scared. She swept up the remains of the shattered little doll and, not being able to throw it away, put the scraps in a cardboard box and pushed it deep into the darkest, loneliest corner of her bedroom closet. Meredith had heard rumors of strange phenomena in the house. The older man she'd bought it from had told her to be careful, that the house could have some strange effects on the mind. Meredith had thought at the time that the man was old and confused - he must’ve been in his late eighties, after all. But now she began to think and ponder on what he had said. Especially the curious statement he had made last: “There’s something wrong with the basement.” The basement was dingy and wet, yes, and perhaps there was some mold or fungus growing in the darkness, but this didn’t bother Meredith. That's what basements are like, after all. *** As she exited the basement again, a knock sounded at the door. It was a fast, frantic knock. Meredith slowly walked towards the door, cautious. She was an older woman living alone, and a robbery wouldn’t be unheard of. She opened the door - it was Mrs. Anders, her neighbor. She looked panicked, her eyes bloodshot and her hair a mess. “Oh, Meredith,” she began, her voice shaking, “please tell me you’ve seen Carter today?” Meredith thought hard. Her mind wasn’t what it used to be, so her memory had started to fade faster lately. “No, I can’t say that I have,” said Meredith, as she stood wracking her brain. A look of disappointment and fear washed over Mrs. Anders. She looked up at Meredith and let out a small gasp. “Meredith, are you feeling alright?” she asked, concern in her voice. To tell the truth, Meredith hadn’t been feeling alright. The last few days, she hadn’t slept much. She was so tired, and her joints were screaming. She could feel her bones scraping together with every move she made. “I’m fine, dear,” said Meredith. Mrs. Anders left and went to the next house. Meredith creaked her way out of the basement and up to look in the mirror in her bathroom. She looked dreadful. Her eyes were sunken, her hair was thin, and her skin had gone ashen-gray. She felt her forehead, expecting to find fever, but she was cold and clammy. “There’s something wrong with the basement,” she muttered to herself, echoing the old man. As she left the bathroom, she felt a sharp pain in her foot. She sat down on her bed and brought it to her lap. A large shard of porcelain was protruding from her heel. She felt dizzy. Grasping the shard, she began to pull it out, wincing in pain. It drew cleanly from her heel, and a small trickle of blood followed it. *** As she came up from the basement, the front door rattled in its frame from a loud, frantic pounding she had never heard before. She made her way to the door, her back brittle, her joints corroded and stiff. It was Mrs. Anders again. “Meredith!” she shouted. Her previous patience and kindness had completely evaporated. “I know you’ve done something with her, you witch!” Her hair was stringy, her eyes sunken. She hadn’t slept in days. “Where is Jenna? I know you know where she is!” Meredith remained calm, almost absent, against these screams of anguish. “Please calm down, dear. Come in and I’ll make you some tea.” “I don’t want tea!” shouted Mrs. Anders, tears running down her face, “I want to know what you’ve done with my children!” Meredith looked puzzled. She leaned in close to Mrs. Anders. Her putrid breath smelled of metal. In a harsh whisper, she uttered, “There’s something wrong with the basement…” Mrs. Anders shoved past Meredith, knocking her to the floor. She stormed through the decaying, decrepit house, or what used to be a house. Dust and mold was abundant. It stunk like a rotting animal. She approached the threshold of the basement and opened the thin door separating the building from the rotting underbelly that was the basement. She stood, staring down into the abyss, her legs shaking and her stomach turning. She already knew what she would find in the moldy darkness. Just as Mrs. Anders’ foot touched down on the first step, she felt a sharp push from behind. She tumbled down the stairs, bashing her head on the banister several times. Her head hit the wet concrete floor before she came to rest at the bottom. She held her hand up in front of her eyes and recognized blood in the dim light. Blood that wasn't hers. At the top of the stairs, she saw the silhouette of Meredith. Speaking with the voices of twenty at once, she solemnly said, “Mors tua, vita mea.” and shut the door. As Meredith walked up the stairs to her bedroom, her dolls, broken, battered, and dusty, littered the hallways. Her bedroom was close. She was so tired. She did what it had asked. She was sure she'd done what it had asked, but she couldn’t seem to remember it, not anymore. Maybe now it would grant her the peace of death. Maybe it would release her husband so they could be together… after. As Meredith lay in her bed, she felt a sharp pain in her chest. She smiled as her vision faded “There’s… something wrong… with the basement,” she muttered as she slowly and calmly faded away, her heart beating more erratically until it finally stopped, and she was free.

{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lamb...", "title": "Untitled", "author": "Zeus", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Ghosts", "Beings"], "content": "Everyone has their story. Your mother’s memory about playing with a Ouija board when she was younger. Your father’s recollection of hearing noises while camping in the woods with friends. Your siblings’ tales of goblins and ghouls that you know deep down were only told to scare you. My dad had one before he passed about a terrifying and ugly demon who lived in our family mansion for 19 years… Jacob, my older brother. But all jokes aside, I’m here to talk about mine. It was around 2015, sometime in October. That year was particularly painful for my family as my father had finally lost his battle with cancer that spring. He entrusted his estate to me, his only daughter, as I was set to take over his position in the family company. To make a long story short though, I let my brother, Jacob, his girlfriend, Veronica, and dog, Zeus, room with me in that mansion. The last thing I wanted to do was sulk around, all alone in Dracula’s Castle before my own inevitable demise. Even though it was spacious and probably worth more than the planet itself, there was always something so off about it. Rather, something was so incredibly off about the surrounding town, Darkhallow. Even the town’s name feels straight out of some Stephen King novel. There our estate stood, looming over the foggy, sleepy town perched upon the mountain like a gargoyle prepared to feast on unsuspecting prey. It was particularly foggy driving up through the dense woods. Upon leaving the last few remnants of green foliage behind, the jagged curves and edges of the Kramer estate pierced through the melancholic moonlight. All was normal that night driving up to my childhood home. Jadis, the maid, and her husband Josiah, our groundskeeper, were just leaving for the night. Exiting my car, the air meandered in a silent waltz with the amorphous fog engulfing the land. That silence, however… it felt visceral and insidious somehow. I had no tangible reason to worry, but I couldn’t help feeling as if I needed to hurry inside. While rummaging through my keys under the stone archways, I finally spotted it. Sitting atop the ‘welcome’ mat laid a simple CD; it announced itself in red print—“The Lamb”. Curiosity clawed its way up to the forefront of my mind. That persistence led me to a decision I’d regret for the rest of my life. “What’s that?” Veronica asked as I sauntered into the foyer. “It’s… The Lamb ,” I teased while presenting the disk to Veronica and Jacob. “It was in front of the door when I got home. You guys didn’t see who dropped it off?” “Nah, I didn’t even know someone came today,” Jacob admitted while Veronica nodded. My eyes fixated on the strange item now in my possession. “Hey, Jake. Can you go get my laptop from the kitchen?” Veronica sat with me in the living room, and Jacob wandered in with my laptop. I took the laptop from his hands and shoved the disk into the player. To be honest, I don’t fully know what I expected, maybe some awful local artist’s mixtape or something, but a video was the last thing on my mind for some reason. The laptop screen lit up with the static remnants of what was obviously once a VHS tape. The crackly screen occasionally gave way to a viewable image of a nun playing an acoustic guitar to a group of children. She kept singing the song “Tonight You Belong to Me”, a slightly creepy-in-retrospect oldie, almost as if she was on repeat. “What kind of fuck ass prank is this?” Jacob bellowed as Veronica and I laughed at his intrusion. But just before I ejected the CD and cleared my laptop of any potential viruses, Veronica noticed something, “Her face…” The nun in the video began to lose something about her, almost like her essence of “humanity” seemed to disappear. The only way I could describe it nowadays is as if her face slowly started to become AI generated, moving in unnatural and impossible ways. She no longer sang her song, but some demented version of it, like it was stuck on a short loop somewhere in the beginning and reversed. That was around the time I removed the CD and tossed it in the garbage. The next couple days were fairly normal, what with Jacob being away for work that week. Although, I do recount the unexplained bumping and knocking at night that I could only rationalize away as the old mansion settling. Garbage day eventually came around, and off our trash went to the dump. That day definitely had a few more odd creaks around the mansion than normal but nothing that rang any alarm bells. It was roughly around two o’clock in the morning when I felt Veronica nudge me awake. “Get up,” she hurriedly whispered while tugging my arm. “Wha-” Before I could even move, she all but yanked me out of bed. “Where’s the gun?” “What? What do you need the gun for?” My eyes finally adjusted to the pitch black. Her eyes stared back at me displaying only primal fear. “There’s someone in my room.” It felt like my heart just ceased, like there was a giant cavity where it should've been. I quietly grabbed the handgun from my nightstand and wandered out into the murky void of the hallway. The moonlight was no longer melancholic as it slithered through the windowpanes. Its malicious tendrils created unholy shapes out of the things in the dark. We silently reached her room, and I slowly grasped for the handle. Each crashing creak of her door sent chills down my spine, alerting my brain of some impending doom. Her room was as silent as a crypt, but in no way did it feel as lifeless as one. Veronica flipped the light switch on and we scoured her room for anyone who might’ve been there. Nothing. She sighed out of relief as we left her room. But before I could even turn to face her, something clawed its way through the still air of the mansion’s winding corridors. Creak . I hauled ass downstairs towards the noise, making my way through the twisting and oblique hallways, gun in hand. Veronica and I finally stopped in the kitchen, staring intently at the now wide-open back door. Sitting there on the kitchen island was a single, small disk… “The Lamb”. Veronica got on the phone with the police as I closed and locked the back door. We turned on every light in that damn mansion and watched cartoons in the downstairs living room while waiting for the cops. The officers must’ve arrived twenty or so minutes later. We greeted Officer Reynolds, a pale man who looked like he did bodybuilding on the side, and Officer Carmichael, a friendly woman with darker skin. Reynolds and Carmichael did their rounds through the mansion, finding nothing. I remember Officer Carmichael talking to us while Officer Reynolds seemed fixated on something in the backyard. Officer Reynolds told the three of us that he would look outside while Carmichael continued taking our statements. It must’ve only been about twenty seconds until all three of us jumped at the sound of Reynolds slamming the back door. He walked into view visibly shaking with his skin even paler than before. “ We need to leave ,” he uttered to Carmichael. And just like that, the two of us were left alone within that god forsaken house. Needless to say, Veronica slept in my bed that night with Zeus. Have you ever just felt like someone’s watching you even if no one’s there? That’s what the next day was like. Constant eyes peering from every shadow in that damned mansion. It was only made worse by Zeus’ newfound interest in the vents and closets. He’d give them his little sniffspections and then just… stare. Even the allure of treats couldn’t break him from whatever was entrancing him. That day, I tried going about my routine as best I could. I cleaned the east wing of the mansion with Jadis, cleaned the music room and locked it up, made a late breakfast, took Zeus outside, locked the music room up, watched TV, and then locked the music room up. That day was also accompanied by the occasional banging at the door, knock, knock, knock , always in threes. “Jacob’s going to be gone an extra three days,” Veronica alerted while I closed the music room door for what seemed like the tenth time that day. “You told him about last night’s little spook, right?” “Yeah, and of course he thinks we just spooked each other being alone.” She giggled. But I could still see terror in her eyes. “You’re welcome to crash in my room for the time being.” That house was already eerie enough as is prior to \"The Lamb\" showing up. A mansion that felt as old as time itself. Its architecture twisted and turned as its cavernous hallways felt like they led to endless voids of shadow. The foyer opened like a castle into a dark unknown as the chandeliers leered overhead. Those open, cavernous rooms carried the echoes of those three knocks as the clock struck midnight. Veronica perked up from the ottoman she was lounging on, her nose no longer buried in the Brandon Sanderson novel she was reading. We stared at each other long enough to communicate without a single word spoken. Who the hell was at our door at this time of night? She lunged from her seat and ran towards the nightstand, grabbing the handgun. I clutched onto the bat from my closet and we both wandered through the jagged halls of murky black. The both of us quietly crept across the carpeted landing of the grand staircase and traversed down into the foyer. The front doors loomed before us, their haunting windows gazing upon us both like prey. But the strange part is how nothing stood outside in the misty moonlight. Nothing was at our door. I should’ve called the cops again as a precaution, yet I felt silly for entertaining that idea with nothing being at the mansion. Veronica huffed as the shape of her white nightgown fluttered back up the staircase; I quickly followed suit. We were back within the dim, marmalade light of my bedroom within a matter of seconds. “Should we call a psychic?” Veronica rubbed her hands together as worry plastered her freckled face. I meandered over to the vanity, bags staining the underside of my eyes. “Don’t tell Jacob. He’s so gonna make fun of us.” Knock… knock… knock. I felt the blood freeze under my skin. Veronica stared at me with a crazed panic seeping into her eyes. It wasn’t at the front door this time. It was at my bedroom door. My fingers ached from the frost that now enveloped them. Zeus stood and stalked toward the bedroom door, the hair down his back sticking straight up like spines. I slowly stood from the vanity with the bat as Veronica readied the handgun. My trembling hands threw the door open as Veronica took aim out into the nothingness of the mansion’s vast hallways. The hallways lingered with emptiness, but that presence from the night before persisted. I don’t know fully what it was, but both of us had the feeling that that door needed to be shut, and we need not speak of what just happened. Something was playing with us. Or was it taunting us? Either way, giving it the attention it sought would’ve only made it more active. We simply tried our best to sleep. Every howl of wind outside woke me, chairs morphed into things in the dark corners of my room, and every snap of the house settling echoed like footsteps down the hallway just outside. The next morning, I met with Jadis and cleaned the west wing. I put my books back up on their shelves, replaced the tablecloth in the dining room, vacuumed the game room, and put my books back up on their shelves again. Night eventually rolled around and I said my goodbyes to Jadis and Josiah. The foyer fell silent as I glided my way up the staircase and wandered through the twisting galleries of family portraits. The shapes tucked away within the maroon wallpaper formed dancing, little spirals leading back to my nightly safe haven. Veronica slept, her auburn hair peeking from the duvet. The comfort of another person being there lent to a swift whirl of sleep. Night crept on until something stirred me from my dreams. Paws hit the floor outside my bedroom and jogged to the other end of the hall. I quietly maneuvered from under the sheets and tiptoed to my door. I questioned to myself what I was doing, but the unmistakable clinks of a dog collar emanated through the hallway. My hand moved without thought, unlatching my door. I tried my best to peer down the hallway but couldn’t make anything out in the pitch black. I looked like a total cliche as I grabbed the electric lantern from atop my dresser and slowly wandered down the passage in my blue robe. I finally managed to reach the corner of the hall and gazed down at the end. Pawing at Veronica and Jacob’s door was Zeus. His little claws dragged on the door as if desperate to escape the darkness of the mansion’s hallways. “Psst. Zeus!” I loudly whispered in a desperate bid for his attention. My voice bounced off the mahogany walls. Zeus lunged his head back to look at me in the moonlight. Something was extremely off about that movement, almost as if he didn’t know his own strength, breaking his neck to look for me. His eyes pierced through the insidious darkness just staring at me. He finally stood up and turned his body around to face me. That’s when I noticed what looked like foam spewing from his mouth in the shadows. “Zeus? Come here!” I worriedly whispered at him. His voyeuristic gaze was lured away from my presence, drifting towards the deep, black hallway behind me. That’s when I heard the pitter patter of paws and the clinking of a dog collar skulk behind me as Zeus and Veronica emerged from the hallway. “What are you doing, Amy?” She asked. I froze, looking at the Zeus who had arrived with her now standing at my side and peering down the corridor. I couldn’t respond to her; I could only point at the other dog lurking at the edge of the shadows across the hall. Veronica’s eyes went wide as she noticed the creature within our mansion. It began to lurch forward as if just learning how to walk. Its broken waltz faded into the shadows of the hallway where the moonlight couldn’t reach. Zeus let out a deep growl as the creature merged into the murky shadows. We could only stand there as still as the dying air until a crackling made itself known. My eyes ignited with fear as the crackling’s source conjured into view. Brokenly lunging down the hallway was the twisted unearthly silhouette of what should’ve been a person. Its arms extended before it with disturbing cracks as its spine and head slithered in unnatural motions. Veronica hauled Zeus into her arms, sprinting down the hallway with me in tow. A rage of clawing tore through that hall as I tumbled down the stairs after Veronica. We stumbled down the curving corridors until we made it to the grand staircase. Upon reaching our exit, that creature let its sickening rage known with one final wail ripping through the foyer. We stumbled out of that house and into my car, leaving that mansion behind in a crazed hysteria. We ended up at a motel, running on nothing but pure and unadulterated fear. That night was accompanied by paranoid bouts and a lack of sleep. Our week was spent slowly going insane locked away within a single, dingy motel room. The only thing either of us could think about was Jacob’s return. That day couldn’t inch closer in our minds if it tried. On the day of his arrival, we called Esther Linklater, a local medium. After hearing our story, she promised to escort us back to the mansion. The state of that damned building when we met up with the sweet old woman was disturbing. Claw marks down the hallways, paint scratched off the wooden doors, every single door busted open, and “The Lamb” blaring through my laptop speakers… its haunting reversed song slinking down the mansion corridors. It goes without saying what the source of the haunting was, and the medium left with “The Lamb” securely tucked in her bag. I don’t know if she still has that cursed disk with her all these years later or if it made its way into someone else’s life. I can only thank her for removing it from ours. But on that day, Veronica and I both learned that disk’s true intention. Jacob’s car was parked in the driveway, but he was nowhere to be seen. To this day, he remains a missing person… a sacrificial lamb. Veronica and I paid for our lives with his. Regret is an unbearable thing, a torture no one should be burdened with. Its crushing weight is only staved off by the hopes that he is somewhere better with our father. Whoever owns that disk now… Do. Not. Play. It.

Eyes adjusting to his dimly lit surroundings, that’s exactly what Nicholas Uldson found himself in- a room he’d never seen before in his life. Calmly looking around the room, Nick tried to get a bearing on the situation. This wasn’t the first time he’d woken up in an unfamiliar place, though usually he’d find himself in an apartment to some woman he hung out with the day before, or a drunk tank at the local precinct. This room, though, almost seemed like a strange mix of the two. While the room was mostly uniform in color (solid greys being the color of choice) and sterile, it also had more of a hotel feel to it: bed, TV, night table, mini-fridge, the usual. Nick scratched the back of his head, and closed his eyes, trying to think back to the night before, but he could only get glimpses of memories through his current haziness- nothing that would explain where he was. Stiffly, Nick sat up from the bed, and did his best to look around for any clues. He started with the immediate- his personal being. A moment of confusion twisted Nick’s face, as he looked down at his grey shirt, and matching grey pants. “Prison, maybe? Some sort of uniform?” He thought to himself, checking his pockets for anything useful, though finding them empty. He swore under his breath. “What the hell’s going on?” Nick began to feel anxious, having more questions than answers. Nick noticed a mirror across the room, and walked closer, to inspect himself further. Nothing out of the ordinary: his short black hair, and trimmed beard were fully intact. His blue eyes scanned for any sort of anomaly- a tag, a bracelet, a brand, a bruise, a mark- anything. To his knowledge, beyond the clothes on his back, nothing was out of the ordinary. With a quick hum, the television across from the bed turned on, startling Nick. On screen, a 3d logo Nick didn’t recognize rotated on a grey background, with a 3 minute countdown. The logo consisted of multiple rings overlapping, with an eye in the center, like the one you’d find on an American dollar. “No, I’m done with this. Too weird for me.” Nick decided, as he went for what seemed to be the front door, only for the handle to not budge. “Yep. Prison.” He swore again. Nick sat back down on the bed, putting his face in his hands. The lack of windows should have been the clue. Raising his head, he surveyed the room once more. On second glance, there were too many… liabilities in the room, for it to be a prison, he decided. “The bed sheets, the wire for the mini-fridge, the breakable mirror… too many risks to take on a prisoner. Where, then? Why?” Nick thought to himself. Nick turned his attention to the timer on screen, counting down its final moments. “I guess I’ll see.” At 0, a chime came from the TV, one that sounded vaguely like some sort of news jingle that you’d hear between segments, or in a cheesy company training video. A woman in a pure white dress appeared on the screen, a stark contrast to the constant use of grey. Her blonde hair fell past her shoulders, piercing blue eyes directly fixed into the camera. Her voice came through, practiced, and purposeful: “Hello, candidates. You may be wondering where you are, and what’s going on.” She explained, in a neutral, yet comforting tone. “You have been given the rare opportunity, to better your current circumstances. We at Serastreaus Recruitment have partnered up with Umbralith Holdings, to conduct the interview process for the position of CEO. Due to your affinities, attributes, and talents, you have been selected as part of the candidate pool.” Nick was floored. “Candidate? For CEO? They’ve got the wrong guy. There’s no way in hell I want to be CEO of whatever this is. Especially for a company that hires recruiters who kidnap their candidates.” He thought to himself. The woman continued: “Before you were sent here, each candidate had agreed to be a part of the interview process. You may not remember agreeing to this interview process. You may not remember much before you awoke, in actuality. Do not worry, this is completely normal. In honor of fairness, and equal opportunity, using the latest in nanotechnology, we have provided every candidate with a MemNet, courtesy of our own Dr. Lethe.” The woman is shifted to the side of the screen, as an image of a brain appears in the center. She points over to a specific part. “Targeting the hippocampus, MemNet alters the memories of a person- allowing them to form new memories, while also allowing us to block out others. This allows us to measure a person’s raw aptitude: memories of past experiences, biases, and opinions of a company can influence decision-making during our interview process. By temporarily blocking these memories, we can assess our candidates based solely on their present qualities, and skills.” Nick scratched his beard as he thought to himself. “Alright, so for some reason, I agreed to this interview process. If I can trust what they’re saying. Things must’ve been bad if I’m desperate enough to say yes to this.” Nick did his best to think back to before he awoke, but was only greeted by faint glimpses of what struggled to be memories. Wanting to avoid a headache, Nick stopped, and refocused back on the woman on the screen. “In a moment, we will be opening your doors to the waiting room, where I will explain the next steps in person. Before that, however, it must be made clear that this interview is, and will be for the entire duration, voluntary. If you are feeling any second thoughts about this process, please push the red button, near the side of this screen.” The moment she says “button”, a small panel on the wall flips around, revealing a small, glowing button. “At any time during the interview process, simply pressing the red button will emit a harmless gas into your room, which will put you to sleep. We will erase any memories of this place, and return your old memories, and you will go back to the life you were living.” Nick stood immediately, and walked over to the button. “Yeah, no, I’m done with this.” He decided in his head. Standing in front of the button, though, Nick hesitated. “This is absolutely nuts… but…” Nick began to weigh his options. “Alright, so clearly, this is weird. Understatement. But an opportunity to be a CEO? Maybe I stick around for a little bit. See what this is like. If I don’t like it, I press the button, just like the woman said, right?” Nick stood there for what felt like minutes, staring at his reflection in this small, red button. To his side, with a hiss and a click, the front door unlocked, and swung open. Tentatively, he walked out of the room, and into the hallway, where he was met by a few other people leaving their rooms, also dressed in the same greys as him. Wordlessly, as a collective, they all noticed there was only one way to go, and so the small crowd made its way down the hall. Unsurprisingly, the hallway opened up into a larger room, with more of the same grey architecture, with chairs, and a raised stage, with a podium, where the woman from the television was standing, her smile like a beaming beacon. Looking up revealed a skylight, with rolling clouds above. The group took their seats in front of the stage, murmuring awkward greetings to each other. The imposing man sitting next to Nick reached his large, calloused hand out to him. “Jimmy Ovaldine. At least, I think I’m Jimmy. Hard to say with all of this brain fog.” he chuckled. “Nick Uldson.” Nick replied, reciprocating the handshake politely. The man’s grip matched his presence. “Certainly one way to apply for a job, huh?” Nick tried to match Jimmy’s tone. Jimmy guffawed. “Hell, whatever happened to just filling out a form?” He nudged Nick, nearly toppling him. Their conversation was cut short the moment the woman at the podium raised her hand to get everyone’s attention. An air of tension drifted through the room. The woman cleared her voice, and began to speak. “On behalf of Serastreaus Recruitment, thank you all for proceeding with this interview. My name is Hope, and I’ll be in charge of your recruitment process. I know there are some questions and concerns you may have- “ the murmurs in the crowd seemed to agree- “but hopefully I should be able to explain everything. As I’ve said in the recording- this process is entirely by choice. Your choice. Should you choose to remove yourself from the candidate pool, simply press the button in your room, and you will be escorted from the facility, back your your old life. This opportunity will be present throughout the entirety of the interview process. “ She paused, as if to give people an opportunity to change their mind again. No one budged. Her smile grew as she continued. “Now, I’m sure you guessed by now, that this isn’t a regular interview.” she chuckled, as did some in the crowd. “Now, due to the nature of our client company, they request that we carry out the interview to the level of caliber that they expect from us. You won’t be answering simple questions, or anything like that. Our goal is to test not what you know, but who you are. You need to align to the same standards and morals as the CEO of Umbralith Holdings, if you wish to take the mantle. “ Jimmy spoke up, his voice rough around the edges. “How are we supposed to show who we are, if we don’t even know what we had for lunch yesterday?” His stout, hardened face scrunched as he spoke, his arms folded over his chest. Hope’s smile never wavered, her attention now focused on him. “Well, that’s a great question, Jimmy.” She began. Immediately, the man was on alert, arms now uncrossed. “Now hold on-” he was interrupted by Hope holding her hand up, to pause him. She continued. “You see, though you don’t have recollection of your past memories, you’re still… you. Who you’ve become, based on the decisions that you’ve made in your life. That’s what we’re measuring. Some of you may be more familiar with the company then others, and we’re not here to measure how good you are at doing research about company figures, and their mission statement. To your core, you need to match the values that Umbralith Holdings desires. Now everyone has an equal playing field.” Jimmy didn’t seem satisfied with the answer, but didn’t seem to protest any further either. Hope looked around the room waiting to see if anyone else would speak up. A hand raised from a woman near Nick. Hope acknowledged her. “So what do we do? How will you know if we’re the right one?” She seemed more anxious than annoyed. Hope wasn’t phased at all by her question, as if expecting this to be the next natural thing to be asked. “Simple- we’re going to run simulations.” Hope started. “You’ll be placed into different settings, situations, and your goal is to resolve them, by whatever means you deem best. We’ll monitor your progress within the simulation, to see if you share the same viewpoints as the CEO of Umbralith Holdings. A few different situations, and the best candidate will go on to take the position of CEO. As easy as that.” Her words flowed in a sing-song pattern, in a comforting way. She motioned behind the stage, to a double set of doors. “We’ll lead you all into the simulation chambers, and begin the first test. Unless there are any questions first?” Silence. Nick had a lot of questions, but felt it wasn’t the time for them. Hope clapped her hands together. “Perfect! No time like the present, right? This way!” The double doors clicked and swung open, as she motioned for the interviewees to stand and follow. Clumsily, Nick, and the rest of the candidates walked onto the stage, and into the dimly lit hallway after her. Immediately upon entering the Hallway, Nick saw a bunch of men and women, each one standing in front of a door, holding a whiteboard with a name on it. As they walked, Jimmy spotted his name and gave a friendly wave to the person holding it. The man smiled back, and ushered Jimmy into the room. It didn’t take long for Nick to find a short, red haired woman holding a sign that read “Nick Uldson”, and he stopped in front of her. “Well, Nick, I assume?” She asked, with a tone that felt more like a question, than a statement. “Unless there’s another Nick Uldson.” He shrugged, with a smile. She brightened at his banter. “Nope! Just you. Come inside.” She chirped, stepping out of his way, gesturing towards the door. He stepped inside. “Thanks, uh…” He paused. “Virginia.” She stated, closing the door behind him. Inside the room felt like something out of a science fiction movie. A stark, white room, with a large chair in the middle, with some sort of high tech machine sticking up from the top of the chair, like a hair drying helmet from a salon. Virginia walked past Nick, and stood in front of a console that resided next to the chair. She motioned towards the chair, while she began tinkering with the dial and knobs at the console. “Have a seat, Mr. Uldson.” She requested, her focus maintained on the task in front of her. Nick hesitated a moment, before sitting carefully into the chair. ‘It felt like one that you sit in at a doctor’s office: comfortable enough for the moment, but not enough to be actually “comfortable”’, Nick decided to himself. “So, what, I attend a few virtual board meetings, and potentially become a CEO?” Nick smirked, looking over to Virginia to see her reaction. She smiled politely, in a customer service type of smile, and made eye contact with him. “Not exactly. These simulations are a bit more complex than that.” She began. “Once inside, if ever you need some direction, or want out, simply check your watch. “ She pointed to her own left wrist as she talked. “It’ll be the only way to communicate with the outside world. Beyond that, you’re on your own in there. Everything else isn’t real. Simple enough, right?” She shrugged, before going back to working at her console, which hissed and clicked with each interaction. “Sure, being thrown into a simulation to do who-knows-what, for what is probably the world’s weirdest interview, though I would have a hard time saying that, because the company also put my brain in a fog. Just like any other Wednesday.” Nick breathed out a sigh, that shaped into a chuckle. Virginia nodded in satisfaction. “Now you’re getting it.” She walked over, and lowered the contraption onto Nick’s head. She pressed a button, and waved, as the hum of the machine began to pick up. “Goooooood Luuuuu-” Her voice seemed to stretch, as did Nick’s vision in the helmet, until everything faded to black. There was enough time for Nick to notice everything’s gone dark, but not enough time for him to make another thought, before he found himself sitting at a bus stop, on the sidewalk of a city. Nick blinked to unblur his vision. The city around him was bustling, akin to something like New York City. Nick looked down at his own clothing, now dressed in professional business attire. Crowds of people passed by the bus bench, seemingly having somewhere to be. Upon looking closer, he noticed all of the people walking by were faceless. He quickly checked his watch. It was a smart watch, with the time, and a written objective: Wait for the bus. “Simple enough,” Nick thought to himself. “Just need to wait for a bus to arrive. Not sure how they’re going to measure anything with this first simulation.” Lost in his thoughts, Nick was surprised when a woman on the phone, sat next to him on the bench. She was clearly at the tail end of a heated conversation. To his continued surprise, when he looked over, she clearly had a face- the young woman was beautiful, and had long black hair, with deep blue eyes. “Yeah, Dad, I know. Look, I-” She frowned when she was cut off. Whatever the person on the other end was saying, the woman clearly seemed to shift to a resignation. “Yes, Dad. I understand. I promise. I’ll talk to you soon. Love you.” She hung up the phone, and sighed, staring straight ahead. Nick let the silence hang for a moment, not sure if he should even say anything. He spoke before he could make up his mind. “Trouble at home?” He asked softly. “What? Oh, uhm. It’s nothing.” The woman jumped slightly when Nick spoke, as if he knocked her out of a stupor. “Just, y’know, Dads being protective.” Nick raised his eyebrow. “Yeah? Protective about what? About some boy you’re seeing, I’m sure.” He teased gently, trying to get the young woman to relax a little. It seemingly worked, as she giggled. “No, it’s not that. Dad actually likes my boyfriend, considering he’s the one who set me up with him-” “What? Like some arranged marriage nonsense?” Nick couldn’t hide the surprise, and disdain in his voice. The woman was flustered. “Well, not quite, I mean, I guess? But it’s okay, he’s great. That’s not the problem.” The woman sighed to collect her thoughts. “Me and my boyfriend want to go to college. Learn whatever we can learn. Go out there and be something. But Dad…” Her eyes sink down for a moment. “Dad wants us to stay with him on the farm. He wants me to promise that I won’t go to school. That it’ll be the end of me if I do go.” Nick let out a mixture of a laugh and a scoff. “You’re kidding, right? Your Dad just wants you to, what help on the farm or whatever? That’s ridiculous. Is that what YOU want?” He asked gently. Inside, Nick was steaming. “Just because he’s her father, he gets to tell her how to live her life? That’s not right.” He thought to himself. “I mean, I love my Dad, but…” The woman sniffled. “I know you haven’t asked for my advice, but I’m going to give it to you anyway,” Nick spoke up. “Life’s too short. You should do what YOU want to do. You want to learn? Go to school? Go for it. Will you make some mistakes along the way? Sure, everyone does. But then you learn from it, you pick yourself up, and you move forward. Look at me-” He motioned to himself. “I’ve made a slew of mistakes. Yet here I am, waiting on a bus for…” He paused. “Well, I’m interviewing for a position of CEO.” “Really?” The woman brushed her nose with the sleeve of her shirt. “But… but what if my Dad disowns me and my boyfriend?” “Then he’s failed at being a supportive dad.” Nick fired back firmly. “A dad disowning his own kid, and her boyfriend, just because they wanted to better themselves? To get an education? Does that sound fair to you? Does that sound right?” “I guess not…” The woman sullenly responds. Nick placed an arm on her shoulder. “Listen. It’s hard to drop family. I get it. They’re blood. Sometimes, though, we need to do what’s right for us. Build a group of people around you that’ll support your interests. You and your boyfriend can go out there, and meet new people. People who like you for who you are, who won’t keep you boxed in, and at the same time, keep you grounded. Who knows- your dad might even come around one day when he’s seen how much you’ve grown.” “That… that sounds nice.” The woman gives a light, genuine smile. “Thank you.” Nick shakes his head, and waves dismissively. “For what? I didn’t do anything besides talk your ear off waiting for-” As if it was there the whole time, suddenly the bus was in front of them, hissing as the doors swung open. The woman stood, and stepped up onto the stairs. She looked back at Nick. “Well, in any case, good luck with your job interview… uhm…” “Nick.” He smiled warmly at her. “Eveline.” She grinned back. As he went to stand up, time slowed just like it did when he first entered the simulation, and his vision narrowed to a pinpoint. Before he knew it, he was back on the VR chair, the helmet rising up off his head, with Virginia typing away at the keyboard. “Well? How’d I do?” He asked, scratching his head. Virginia nodded, reviewing the data collected. “You did very well, Mr. Uldson. You’ll be making it to the next round. We’ll escort you back to the room, where you can rest, and we’ll let you know when the next scenario will start.” As they walked him back to his room, Nick mulled over the scenario. It was clear to Nick they weren’t actually measuring how good he was at waiting for a bus. It was his conversation with Eveline that was important, but Nick couldn’t figure out why. “What was it about that conversation that showed he had qualities the company was looking for in their CEO?” Nick deliberated internally. Nick spent most of the time in his room trying to break down the significance of the scenario. It was hard for him to sleep- the passage of time was tough to tell, without any windows in the room itself. Some time later, the TV had turned on by itself, with a short timer. Once the timer reached zero, the door clicked, and hissed, signifying its opening. Nick walked past the red button on the wall of his room, without giving it a single glance, and into the atrium, the grey clouds continuing to roll overhead on the skylight. There was a slight thinning of the crowd compared to before the first simulation. “Probably all of the people who did poorly in the first round were sent back home,” Nick surmised in his head. Quickly, the candidates were led back to the VR rooms, where Nick once again found Virginia. “Hi Nick! Ready for the next round?” She asked in an artificially sweet manner. “Sure, not much else to do around here, right?” Nick laughed, making himself comfortable on the chair. “Righty-o!” She beamed, working at the console to get everything set up. “Everything’s all set.” She walked over to Nick, lowering the device on his head, and the familiar crawling of time took over his being. When his vision readjusted, Nick found himself staring into an interrogation room, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering slightly. Through the glass wall in front of him, sat a man in intricate robes, wearing a wooden mask over his face. Nick was about the check his watch for what to do, when a voice behind him startled him. “Sir, thank you once again for coming. If anyone is going to get this guy to open up, it’d be you.” A short, gruff man stood next to Nick, smelling of cigarettes. His jet black muttonchops framed his hardened, scowling face. “Picked this guy up from the edge of the woods. We’ve been looking for a group of people that fit his description.” The man motioned to the robed figure’s appearance. “Their leader’s been on our radar for some time, but he’s elusive. This guy seems shook, but he won’t talk. Maybe you can get in there, and help him out a little?” Nick furrowed his brow for a moment. “Interrogations? What does this have to do with being a CEO? What kinda job am I really signing up for?” He thought to himself. Nick nodded to the stout man, before entering the interrogation room. Without moving his body, the robed man’s head zeroed in on Nick, following him as he sat down. Nick cleared his throat, in an attempt to calm himself as he stared down the intricate carvings of the man’s wooden mask. “Good morning. You got a name?” Nick was gentle in his approach. “Jud.” The muffled voice came out stiff. “Jud? Just Jud, or…?” Nick waited for an answer that didn’t come. After enough of a pause, Nick continued. “Alright then, just Jud. So, Jud… can you tell me what you were doing at the edge of the woods?” “Just walking, Sir.” Jud’s voice was practiced, calm. “I’ve got to say, that’s a very fun jogging outfit. You often walk around in ceremonial robes?” Nick attempted to lighten the mood, and dig a little deeper at the same time. “All of us do.” Nick leaned a little closer. “All of us? As in, you and your friends? That’s actually one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you today.” Visible tension rippled through Jud. “Take it easy, I just want to ask some questions is all.” Nick said softly, in a disarming manner. “Your friends: Are they close by?” There was a pause. Then, one slow nod from Jud. “How close by? My colleagues said you were picked up from the woods- are they in there?” This time, no reaction from Jud. Nick sighed, and decided upon another approach. “Tell me about yourself, Jud.” Another long pause. But this time, Nick let the pause lengthen, hoping it’s size would cause Jud to want to fill the space. It had worked. “There’s… not much to say.” Jud had spoken solemnly. “Nonsense. Everyone’s got a story, I want to hear yours.” Nick spoke with a tone that was inviting, that often lured people into a sense of calm. Jud’s shoulders seemed to lose some tension. “I… I have found purpose. With others, who wish for the coming of a new age. I am glad to serve.” A layer of Jud’s practiced tone seemed to peel away. “A new age? No doubt led by your leader?” Nick felt like a hound picking up the scent, when Jud shifted at the word ‘leader’. “I’ve heard some great things about your leader.” Nick lied, testing the waters. “He.. he is capable of much.” There was a little shiver from Jud. Nick pounced on this moment of hesitation. “He is? Like what? Enlighten me.” Nick relaxed his posture, to soothe the energy of the room. “My leader… he…” There was a pause, a clear deliberation going on in Jud’s mind. “Hey, no judgment here. I just want to learn, is all.” Nick worked to disarm the man with his words. “He has done good for many people, and we have built a small community in the woods. But recently… recently he has practiced necromancy.” Jud’s posture shifted, as if he had just unburdened himself. Nick sat upright. For a moment, he was taken aback. Nick assured himself that the man was probably just crazy. He needed to placate the man to get more. “Necromancy? That’s some serious stuff. Are you sure about that?” Jud nodded. “I saw it with my own eyes. One of our own was sick. Rus. We were worried he may need a hospital. Our leader insisted he would be fine. I… I watched Rus die.” Jud’s voice hitched just for a moment, though out of fear, or sorrow, it was hard to tell with the mask. He continued. “ We buried Rus. Days passed. Our leader gathered us all up, and dug up Rus’ grave. He spoke some words, and I watched Rus get up. He climbed out of his own grave.” Jud grabbed at his wooden mask, and pulled it off. Nick nearly flinched, not sure what to expect under the mask, only to find a man like any other underneath, indistinguishable in any extraordinary way from any person on the street. Jud scratched at his beard, and furrowed his brow. “He… he talks of immortality. Of what’s to come.” Jud’s hand rattled against the table, fingers nervously tapping. Nick gently placed his hand onto Jud’s to stop the tapping. “Clearly you seem a little shook. It’s okay, I would be too.” Jud made eye contact with Nick. “It wasn’t always like this. Originally, I believed in what he said. Of a new world. But this? This is… It’s not right.” “Is that why you were out of the woods? Looking to get away?” Nick knew he was on the right track. With just the right amount of comforting words, he was sure he could get Jud to open up fully. “Anything to help a guy get out from under the thumb of someone else.” Nick thought to himself. “Maybe… I don’t know. He probably already knows I’m out here, talking to you. He sees all.” The fear was crawling its way up Jud’s throat, his widened eyes tearing. “I won’t let anything happen to you, I promise.” Nick squeezed Jud’s hand reassuringly. “But it sounds like your boss has something big planned. You mentioned ‘what’s to come’?” Jud nodded. “He has plans for all of us- not just those in the woods. Soon.” Nick’s face shifted, his relaxed, soothing demeanor melted away into clear determination. “Jud- that’s not good. You see it yourself: necromancy, immortality, premonitions… clearly, your leader is dangerous. It doesn’t seem like this plan’s going to go well for anyone.” Nick made direct, unflinching eye contact with Jud. “But you can do something about this. You seem like a good man, someone who doesn’t want bad things to happen, right?” Jud seemed speechless. His body trembled as he nodded. Nick continued: “Exactly. Your conscience was telling you to come find us. You’re doing the right thing. You can help a lot of people by telling us where your leader, and the rest of your community are, in those woods. I can promise you a safe break from this all.” Nick broke physical contact with Jud, and leaned back into his chair. “I could probably even give you some money to help get you started on the right foot. Think of it like a reward for keeping the community safe.” “Y-you’d do that for me?” Jud’s voice carried a nervous hope. Nick smiled, knowing he was on the cusp of success. “Of course I would. Enough for a down payment on a house, or at least a year or so of getting your bearings. Does this sound like a fair trade? You just need to show us where your community is, and we’ll do the rest.” The flicker of hope on Jud’s face wavered for a moment. Nick knew how to secure the deal, it hadn’t been his first time haggling. “I promise no one will get hurt. We just want to make sure your leader’s not gonna do anything that’ll hurt a lot of people, alright?” Jud looked at his hands, then back at Nick, before letting out a shaky sigh. “Yeah. Yeah alright, that’s fair. Gimme a map, I’ll show you how to get there.” Nick noticed that although Jud agreed, he looked slightly more nervous then he was just a minute ago. “Something else on your mind?” Nick asked, signaling the person on the other side of the window for something to write with. Jud stared grimly at Nick. “He was right, in the end. He told me this would all happen, Nick. He… he knows I was going to come talk to you. Why… why did he let me leave?” Nick was taken aback at Jud using his name, without giving it to him. Before Nick could question further, time slowed to a stop. Once again, his vision dimmed, and in a matter of seconds, he found himself back in the VR chair. Virginia lifted the helmet off his head, though her smile from earlier was gone. “What’s up, Virginia? Don’t tell me I messed up that bad.” Nick felt a lump in his throat, unsure if he made a mistake. Virginia simply shook her head, her customer service voice all but gone. “Nope. You did great, Nick. Really great.” Though her words were praise, her tone seemed anything but. “So then why-” Virginia cut him off, motioning towards the door. “Someone should be out in the hall ready to escort you back into the room. I’ll see you for the next round.” She said dismissively, writing something down as she analyzed the data from her screen. Nick just nodded, and left the room, stewing in his own thoughts as he followed a blonde-haired man back to his room. Upon reflection, Nick realized he never actually checked his watch for his objective. “Maybe I wasn’t supposed to get that guy to open up. It just seemed like the right thing to do.” Nick scoffed to himself. “Right thing to do. Yeah, like any of this makes sense. Why would interrogating some cultist help show if I’m ready to be some CEO?” Once back in his room, he sat on his bed, and groaned. “I know it’s just a simulation, but I didn’t think they’d do weird stuff like have the guy know my name. Just when I think I have this figured out, I feel like I’m thrown for a loop.” He thought to himself. “They’re probably going to kick me out while I sleep.” He said, pressing his fingers on the bridge of his nose in frustration. Nick had decided he wanted to be awake when he was removed. There, he replayed the situation in his head over and over until sleep took him. He awoke from the buzz of the TV, as it once again turned on, completely on its own. The screen showed a timer. Nick was shocked. “I guess I really did do a good job, and I’m onto the next round.” Nick thought to himself. As the timer ticked down, Nick had made a simple observation: Twice now he had slept, but not once did he feel hungry, or thirsty. It was hard to tell how much time had actually passed between the simulations, and how long he had slept, considering there was no way to measure time there without any clock anywhere, and when in the atrium, the continuous rolling grey clouds above made it hard to identify the time of day. Nick didn’t have much time to contemplate this oddity, however, as the timer finished its countdown, and the doors clicked open once again. Stepping into the atrium, Nick’s eyes widened for a moment when he saw a handful of people gather in the atrium, way less than the previous round. Nick surmised that if this next round’s tougher than the last, this may be the final one. Nick steeled himself, taking a deep breath, his eye on the prize. Once more, he was led to the back, where he found Virginia waiting for him, her smile gone. She motioned for the chair in the room, and he sat. Nick sighed. “Virginia, I’m sorry if I did anything wrong yesterday.” He offered his apology sincerely. She shook her head, and sighed. “No, no. It’s alright Nick. I shouldn’t have acted the way I did. It was unprofessional of me.” The machine hummed to life as she started it up. “Good… Good luck in there, alright?” She forced a small smile on her face. Nick smiled back. “I’ll do the best I can.” As his vision tunneled, he could see the sadness flicker in her eyes for a brief moment. The first of Nick’s senses to acclimate to the environment this time was not sight, but smell- dirt, sweat, and gunpowder filled his nose, as his eyes adjusted to the sight in front of him. He was in an open field, with militaristic tents of various shapes and sizes scattered around him. Looking down at his clothes, he noticed he was in army fatigues. Nick furrowed his brow. ‘These situations are getting more and more intense.’ He reflected back to the first test, a simple conversation at a bus stop, now finding himself on the outskirts of what he assumed was a war. He checked his watch, and raised his eyebrow at the objective. “Do the right thing.” A woman approached him, in similar attire to his own. “Lieutenant Uldson, sir- Captain’s looking for you. He’s called everyone into the briefing tent.” “Uhm, very good.” Nick cleared his throat. “Lead the way. Let’s not keep him waiting.” She nodded, and together, they stepped into a large tent, filled with 20 or so people. An older man stood at the front of the room, his short white beard starkly in contrast to his slightly tanned skin. Despite clearly being older, the man radiated an air of strength, and confidence. The woman led Nick to the older gentleman. “Captain Jehsab, I found Lieutenant Uldson.” Captain Jehsab smiled warmly at Nick, and placed a hand on his shoulder. His words were warm, like the sun through a window on a Spring day. “Lieutenant Uldson. Glad you could join us. I didn’t want you to miss this briefing.” Nick shook his head. “Of course, Captain. Wouldn’t dream of it.” Captain Jehsab motioned toward an empty seat toward the front, and Nick sat down. The grumblings and passive conversation in the room died out nearly immediately from one simple hand gesture from Jehsab. It was clear to Nick that Jehsab was well respected by the people in the tent. “Thank you all for meeting on such short notice.” Jehsab begun. “Progression on the front lines has been difficult. I know you’re all aware. I hope that what I have to bring to the table today could turn the tide in our favor. I’d like to present our latest weapon- The Clay Protocol.” Captain Jehsab motioned towards a shape just outside the tent. When the shape entered, murmurs of confusion and gaps rattled through the tent. Entering the tent was Jehsab, who stood next to the original Captain Jehsab. Nick stared at the second Jehsab in shock. “Cloning?” The thought flashed in Nick’s brain The more that Nick stared at the second Jehsab, however, the more unnerved he was- while it mostly looked like Captain Jehsab, the more he stared, the more irregularities were clear: his eyes were too far spaced apart, his nose was slightly at a different angle, his back was a little more hunched, his fingers a little too long. Nick had to look away from the clone. Captain Jehsab raised his hands, to quiet the crowd one more. “At ease, everyone. Calm. I’ll explain. For some time now, I’ve been heading research on a bit of a side project that I am sure will bring us to the next level. I myself volunteered to be the first subject. This being next to me, is made with my DNA. It has all of my knowledge, and skills. It’s not… perfect, but that’s okay. It’s a fully functioning soldier, ready to take to the battlefield. We call them the ‘Molded’, as if they were shaped from clay.” Nick shook his head. “There’s got to be a better name than ‘Molded’.” He snickered to himself. The flap to the tent rustled, and in stepped three more Molded, all with their own unique minor irregularities. Captain Jehsab cleared his throat. “We had about two squads’ worth of Molded shipped in last night. Tomorrow, we head for the front lines. Lieutenant Uldson-” As the Captain turned his attention to Nick, Nick sat up straight. “Sir?” “You will be leading a platoon- two squads of our soldiers, and two squads of my Molded. I will be accompanying you to ensure everything goes smoothly, and to collect info on how the Clay Protocol handles field testing. Understood?” Nick nodded. “Sir, yes sir.” A pit formed in Nick’s stomach. Nick had no problem with Captain Jehsab himself- he seemed like a great leader, well-loved. But glancing over to the other slightly misshapen Molded in the room gave him a sense of unease. They didn’t blink. Their breathing was irregular. He wasn’t even sure if they could speak. He was afraid to find out. Captain Jehsab wrapped up the meeting, providing the details of the mission the next day- they would make their way to the front lines, to push toward where they think the enemy leader was hiding out. Once dismissed, Nick made his way back to the barracks, along with a crowd of other soldiers. He overheard one of them. “Okay, it’s not just me, but… they’re creepy, right?” A younger man hissed to another soldier. Nick walked up alongside them. “It’s not just you,” Nick replied, surprising the younger man. “Oh, Lieutenant Uldson! Sir, I didn’t mean-” The young soldier choked and sputtered, like a dying car. Nick looked at the tag on the man’s shirt, reading ‘ANDERSON’, and shook his head. “Relax, Anderson. I’m not gonna tell. I agree with you. I don’t like the look of them either.” Anderson sighed in relief. “Y-yeah, I mean. They don’t look right. I get it, expendable troops, but… they feel off.” “Well then, you’ll just need to watch my back out there, right?” Nick nudged him, and smiled. Anderson grinned. “Between you, and the Molded? I guess I’ll go with you, sir.” Nick rested in his cot, surrounded by fellow soldiers. He stared up at the olive drab canopy of the tent. “I guess ‘doing the right thing’ is succeeding in this mission.” He thought to himself. “They must be testing me on making decisions in high stress environments.” Sleep took him quickly. The hustling and bustling of the tent in the dark hours of the morning jolted him awake. Men and women were getting ready for the front lines, their nervous energy heavy enough to choke the air of the tent. Nick joined them in his preparations for the day, seemingly knowing exactly what to do- Nick assumed it was just a benefit of the simulation. Outside of the tent, Nick froze- lined up in front of the transport were 22 Jehsabs, with Captain Jehsab standing in front of them, differentiated by his clothing. The clone Jehsabs stood motionless, in perfect lines, like wax figures on display in a museum, or terracotta soldiers in a tomb. Captain Jehsab waved to Nick and the approaching soldiers. “Good morning, Lieutenant. Your men ready to head out?” Nick approached, as the soldiers around him piled into the transport. “As ready as ever, Captain. How about you?” Captain Jehsab turned to his Molded, and with one flick of his wrist, they all began to move as one, shuffling into the convoy vehicles, akin to ants following a trail. Captain Jehsab smirked. “Of course. A simple thought, and they move. Complete control over highly specialized squads. We’ll make it out of this war yet.” His words were meant to be soothing, but they only sent a chill through Nick’s spine. “Right, Captain.” Nick gave a quick salute, and hurried over to the other soldiers. The smell of gasoline, oil, and dust rolled through the air, as the cacophony of war vehicles coughed to life, and set off from the comfort and safety of the base. The heavy thrum of the engine made most conversation impossible, and after hours of traversal, the truck Nick was in skirted to a stop. Nick peeked his head around the truck in front of him, realizing why they had stopped. The grassy plains were giving way to sand, and buried in the sand were small bits of metal. A minefield. The soldiers piled out, as did the Molded. Nick approached Captain Jehsab. “Sir, I think it’s time we put your Molded to the test. We can load one up with some minefield gear, and send it out. No risk to our own.” A look briefly clouded Captain Jehsab’s face, one that Nick recognized as hesitation. “Right. Of course, Lieutenant.” He cleared his throat, and with a nod, one of the off-putting Molded geared up. This one in particular had a longer torso, and Nick swore it had an additional earlobe on both ears, though it was hard to tell. The platoon watched as the clone stepped into the sand, and began to clean up a path through the mines. Nick was impressed by the efficiency of the clone, as it swept its way through the mine field. About a half hour later, the path seemed clear enough to traverse. Relief seemed to wash over Captain Jehsab, and he signaled for the clone to come back. There must have been a mine hidden deeper in the sand, or something along those lines, as one minute, the clone was hurrying back, and the next, bits of gore sprayed the air like a gruesome firework. For a moment, the air seemed still. Nick heard a stifled gasp from Captain Jehsab, and when he turned to look at him, he noticed a tear running down Captain Jehsab’s cheek. “Captain? You alright?” Nick placed a hand on Captain Jehsab, who quickly regained his air of complete control. “Yes Lieutenant I’m fine. It’s just, jarring, is all.” Jehsab shook his head, and turned to the rest of the platoon. “Path’s clear, everyone. Let’s make it through.” Molded and soldier alike both began the march through the sand, with the Molded in the lead. They moved past the sandy pit, and into the dense woods, in search of their target hideout. The sound of snapping twigs, and rustling branches bounced off every tree as the group made it’s way through the underbrush. Riverbanks, once flowing with fresh water, were dried up, making perfect natural trenches, each one the perfect spot for an ambush. Nick decided to speak up. “Captain, shouldn’t we send one of your-” The Captain turned and raised a finger to stop Nick. “No. There’s no need for us to burn away our resources too quickly. Besides, we have men who can scout better than any of my Molded can.” Jehsab points to two men. “Ramirez. Burnwood. You two move ahead of us. Quietly. See if our intel is leading us the right way.” Nick wanted to protest- His thoughts were racing: Why have expendable soldiers if we aren’t going to use them? Isn’t that what they’re here for? The more dangerous situations?” In that moment, Nick held his tongue. He assured himself that the Captain has more experience with these things, and to follow his lead. Ramirez and Burnwood exchanged a glance at each other, before nodding, and hurrying ahead. The Captain turned to the rest of the platoon. “The rest of you- we’ll bunker down here, in this dried riverbank. Wait for them to return.” With a hand signal, the Molded began unpacking their bags, with the soldiers following suit. It was unnerving the speed and practiced pace that the Molded worked at- their heads never fully turning to meet what they’re working on, their movements fluid enough to not be mistaken for a robot, but not natural enough to be mistaken as fully human. Occasionally, one would wheeze, or gurgle, seemingly at random. Nick surmised if the externals weren’t fully perfect, their insides must be all sorts of wrong as well. Short lifespans designed imperfectly for a brutal task, never hitting the perfection of the man they’re cloned from, standing in front of them. Nick couldn’t think of a worse fate. Captain Jehsab spent most of his time among the Molded, leaving Nick to be among the soldiers. In their downtime, as the sun began to set, Nick relayed the plan explained the previous day to the men and women in front of him, reiterating their plan of attack once they reach the hideout. “Alright, listen up. We have a small one-man army on our side, and I plan on utilizing it.” Nick began, staring at the huddled faces surrounding him. “Once Ramirez and Burnwood get back, we’re going to send the Molded out first. We’re gonna have them draw fire, suppression, the whole nine yards. The guys inside will think we’re doing a full frontal assault, they’ll need everyone focused there. While the Molded hold out and take the brunt of it all, we’ll find a way in through the back, trapping them inside. It keeps us out of harm’s way, and gets the job done clean.” A round of nods went around the circle, most seeming to agree. Despite the situation, the mood was hopeful. With a strong plan in place, some of the soldiers felt relaxed enough to smile, and laugh. Most of the smiles were erased quickly, though, from the words uttered by the Captain as he approached. “Absolutely not. Change in plans. In no way are we going to put my Molded in anymore unnecessary danger- not after earlier.” Nick stood up, facing the Captain. This time, he wouldn’t bite his tongue. “Captain, with all due respect- that’s what they’re made for.” The Captain’s face twisted into a slight grimace. “That’s easy to say when you don’t watch yourself become a red mist. We treat them as equals. That’s an order. Understood?” There was a stare down between Nick and Captain Jehsab, neither backing down. Slowly, Captain Jehsab repeated his question. “Understood, Lieutenant Uldson?” He folded his arms, the air of calm power he normally emanated now a sizzling anger. Nick waited for one more moment, before spitting out his response. “Sir, yes Sir.” Satisfied that Nick was in line, his face softened, and he resumed his normal demeanor. “That goes for the rest of you, too. You need to treat each of me as if they were myself, understood? Not a single Jehsab is thrown away. I want them to be shown the same level of respect. As far as you’re concerned, they outrank you. Understood?” The crowd fired back a unanimous “SIR YES SIR!”, but the darting eyes among the soldiers told a different story. “Good. The plan’s simple- Uldson, you and a few of your best shots will be up front providing cover. A distraction. I know my Molded will be able to get around back- they’re efficient, and will be able to be on the same wavelength in there. Any objections?” Jehsab took a moment to look into every soldier’s eyes. No one in the group was brave enough to speak up, not after the stare down with Nick. Most looked away, some with solemn nods of reluctant approval. Jehsab smiled. “Very good. We wait for our scouts, then tomorrow, at the break of dawn, we set out.” Jehsab turned, and moved back toward his waiting Molded, all staring blankly at the soldiers, eyes motionless, breath shallow, like a horde of zombies on pause. The sun blinked out its last rays of light, and soon enough, darkness scuttled in. Nick saw a body approach him in the dried riverbank. He recognized him immediately. “Anderson.” Nick nodded politely, as he tapped his leg in anger. “It’s not right, man,” Anderson whispered as he sat, keeping his voice low. “Captain’s crazy if he thinks I’m going to treat these slack-jawed bozos as superior.” Nick nodded. “You shouldn’t. They’re gross reflections of him, but because they’re his, he’s favoring them over us.” Anderson tensed his fists. “What do we do? We can’t let him get away with this, right?” Nick slowly nodded, as he thought back to the watch’s message. He noticed a few men around him paying attention to the conversation, looking up at him for guidance. “No. The right thing is to take care of you guys. You’ve been loyal. Put your lives on the line. The Captain can’t just throw that away, and treat us like we’re nothing. I will NOT put your lives in undue danger. Especially not for his Molded.” “Damn right.” “We’re with you, Lieutenant.” “Exactly.” Encouraging words were whispered among the small group of soldiers around Nick. From the brush outside of the trench came the quick rustling of leaves and grass. Nick immediately shot up his head to look, and there, alone, hunched Burnwood, gasping for air. “Burnwood! Where’s Ramirez?” Nick brought him down into the trench, checking him for wounds. “He.. he…” Burnwood choked on his words, exhausted. “Take it easy, Burnwood. Breathe. “ Nick calmed the soldier down, not finding any wounds on him. Sucking in air, Burnwood did his best to explain. “Found the compound. On our way back… Ramirez didn’t see the pit. Sharpened Reeds. He didn’t….” He clenched his teary eyes. “He didn’t…” Nick gently shushed Burnwood. “Hey, hey. You’re alright. You’re alright.” Nick was furious. Exactly what he was afraid of came to fruition. ‘A family was now missing their son, husband, and father. And for what? So a clone could take another measly breath?’ Nick stood, a few soldiers standing with him, and together, they navigated their way over to the side of the natural trench, where Jehsab sat among his Molded. Like clockwork, each turned their head toward Nick, following him as he walked past them, their wheezing, and shuddering making Nick feel tense. Nick stood a few feet away from Captain Jehsab, before clearing his throat. “Captain, we need to talk.” The captain was busy securing his pack, not turning to look at Nick. “About what, Lieutenant?” Nick steeled himself. He knew he was about to step out of line, but to him, in the name of doing what’s right, he had to. “About the way you’re treating your soldiers. How you’re treating these ‘things’.” Nick motioned to the offset faces around him. The word ‘things’ gave Captain Jehsab pause. He stood, and turned to look at Nick, and his small group of soldiers. “Oh? And what, Lieutenant, is wrong with what I’m doing?” “Captain, with all due respect, cut it. As Lieutenant, I can’t sit here and put lives on the line, when you have perfectly capable fodder here. I need to get these men home. Men who’ve put blood, sweat, and tears in for you. Men who would ask ’How high?’ if you asked them to jump. Ramirez is dead. He’s not coming back.” Nick felt himself getting more upset by the minute. Something about a man of power abusing it sent his blood into a boil. Captain Jehsab stepped closer. “I mourn for Ramirez, I really do, but he knew what he was signing up for. Right now, I’m asking my men to treat these Molded with the utmost respect. Most are. Why aren’t you, Lieutenant?” “Most, but not all, Captain. Most of them are willing to just blindly do as you say, but that ain’t me. Not us.” He motioned to the men behind him. “I’m not gonna sit here, and let you, and you, and you-” Nick starts pushing the Molded standing near him. They don’t react beyond the initial push. “-to tell me that our lives are worth less!” Nick was breathing heavily. “Stand down, Lieutenant. Now.” Captain Jehsab growled, the thunder in his voice rumbling Nick’s ribcage. It was either that, or Nick’s own frustration. Nick couldn’t tell which. “No! Who are you to throw away lives? What makes you better than everyone else?! I need YOU to stand down. I’m taking over this operation.” Sweat dripped from Nick’s brow, as he gritted his teeth. The Molded began to shuffle forward. Jehsab slowly shook his head. “That isn’t how this is going to play out.” Nick knew he needed to make a decision. In a moment, he’d be swarmed with Molded. He had to act fast. His hand brushed against his waist, and found something rounded on his belt. A knife handle. A thrumming beat against his ears, his pulse growing louder. The right thing to do. Nick sprang forward. In one swift motion, he unclasped the blade from his knife holder, ready to strike. He screamed as he thrust the blade forward, aiming right for Captain Jehsab’s heart. Tears streamed down Nick’s face, as the knife tip made contact with the fabric of Jehsab’s shirt, various Molded closing in on Nick. The knife stopped. Everything stopped. Nick’s vision began to fade into a pinpoint. Gasping for air, heart racing, he found himself back on the chair, with a shaking Virginia standing over him. Wordlessly, he stared up at her, tears running down his face, as his heart rate calmed. “Virginia, I-” She hushed him quickly. “Listen, I don’t have much time. Nick- you need to press the button. Drop out. Please.” “What?” Nick stood up, confused. “What are you-” There was a knock on the door that rattled Virginia. “Please. When they get you back in the room, press the button.” She hurried him toward the door before Nick could ask any of the questions he wanted to. His mind swam in the short walk back. He couldn’t believe it- what he had just done. He just tried to kill a man. Sure, it wasn’t real, but his intent was. Once back in the room, Nick screamed into his pillow. “How could he have let his emotions get the better of him? How could he mess things up so badly?” These questions swarmed his mind, teetering him on the verge of freaking out. But he didn’t. He took a breath, and steadied himself. In his eyes, he was saving lives-if he hadn’t intervened, more good men would have died. “There are too many men out there ready to do the wrong thing with the power they have. Fathers forcing their daughters to live the life they set out for them. Men promising fantastic things to those foolish enough to believe it. Complacent leaders sending men to die.” His internal monologue started a fire in his heart. Nick clenched his fists, and swore under his breath. He felt he did the right thing, every time. Nick was resolute in his stance: Those with power choose to wield it wrong. If he could get this position as CEO, maybe he could finally put a stop to that trend. Across the room, he stared at the button, thinking about Virginia’s words. The TV turned on once more, and Nick stared at the countdown, unflinching. “Whatever comes, I’m going to face it head on.” The door clicked open once the timer was over, and Nick power walked his way out into the Atrium. There, waiting for him, was only one person- Hope, the woman from the beginning. Not another soul stood in the atrium. “Congratulations, Mr. Uldson.” She applauded gently, as Nick walked up. “You have been deemed the next CEO at Umbralith Holdings!” Nick stared at her, dumbfounded. “Me? Are you serious? You’re not mistaking me for another candidate?” She simply smiled, shaking her head slightly. “Not at all, Mr. Uldson. The results are clear- you’ve got the job.” She motions with her head down one of the halls. “Take a walk with me, Mr. Uldson. I’m sure you have plenty of questions, and I’d like to help you get started.” She began walking down one of the halls, and Nick quickly followed. “So, that’s it? I’m a CEO? Your boss now?” Nick asked, catching up to her. “No no, Mr. Uldson. You’re the CEO of Umbralith Holdings. Remember- my company has been tasked to help with the selection process. Like a recruitment agency.” She explained, as they walked down the winding corridor. Turning the final corner, Nick was surprised- at the end of the hallway was a door unlike anything he had seen in this place up unto this point. In stark contrast to all the greys, this door was an intricate, large set of bronze doors. As they walked closer, Nick was able to make out various human shapes, all delicately carved, and inlaid into the door. Next to the door, in contrast, was a simple call elevator button. With a press from Hope, the ornate doors swung open, to a metal elevator. She gently ushered Nick in. “So, up to the penthouse then?” Nick joked. Hope gave another smile. “Not quite.” She pressed the only other, unmarked button in the elevator. With a screech, the elevator slowly began its descent. There was a small pause, before Hope cleared her throat, and began to speak. “You’ll have to forgive us, Mr. Uldson. I know what you’ve gone through wasn’t easy, but those experiences truly do give us a good look at what kind of person you are, and you didn’t disappoint.” Nick raised an eyebrow at her. “Do you… hear yourself? I can’t believe any company would want me as their leader after what I pulled.” As the elevator lurched lower, Nick could feel the heat in the environment warming his frame, a nice difference from the sterile, cold environment of the place above. Hope looked at her inquisitively. “What do you mean? You did perfectly on each and every simulation.” “Really? Trying to kill a guy was the right move?” Nick made eye contact with Hope, her blue eyes didn’t waver. “You haven’t figured it out, yet?” She tilted her head curiously. “What? Figured what out?” Nick was beginning to lose his patience. “The CEO of Umbralith Holdings. We went for that title because it scares less people away in the initial interview process. If we just out and said ‘The Devil’-” “What?!” Nick cut her off. “What kind of game are you playing? Is this some kind of sick joke?” “I assure you, Mr. Uldson: It’s not a joke. You have been chosen to be next in line to be the Devil.” The warmth of the elevator no longer comforted Nick. “But the Devil’s a guy! Satan! You can’t BE the Devil.” Nick protested. “That’s what a lot of people think. Sure, Lucifer, or whatever you want to call him, was the first Devil. Over time, however, we’ve found that years of being manipulative and vindictive wear a soul down, to the point that they’re no longer ‘the Accuser’ that they need to be. There needs to be bad in the world, for people to know when they’re blessed. Without the bad, people get complacent. ‘The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.’” Hope explained in a manner more casual than the situation called for. Nick couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “So, what, you’re saying I make the perfect Devil?” When Hope nodded, Nick pressed further. “I may not be a good guy, but there’s no way I’m like the Devil.” “No? Alright then, Mr. Uldson. Let’s review, yes?” Hope tapped a finger to her head. “Let’s start with the first simulation. Eveline.” Nick scoffed. “Yeah, her father was stopping her from bettering herself. I didn’t do anything wrong telling her to carve her own path with her boyfriend.” Hope nodded. “Of course. The snake felt he was in the right to tell Eve to eat the Apple of Knowledge, despite her father’s commands.” Despite the growing heat, Nick’s blood ran cold, his face going pale. “Wait, each simulation…” “Well, we couldn’t have just made you a snake in a garden, right? Too on the nose. But if the core values are the same, and you make the same choices Lucifer did…” “Most people would have made that choice. That doesn’t make me the Devil!” Nick fired back. “Well, if that’s all you did, sure. But you did more than that, didn’t you? After all, you seemed to do just fine convincing Judas to betray Jesus.” Hope’s demeanor only seemed to frighten Nick more with each passing moment. “Jud?” Nick managed to croak out. Hope nodded. “We can’t forget the most, well…” Hope searched for a word, before laughing to herself, “damning evidence of all-you tried to put a knife into Jehovah Sabaoth himself, for putting those made in his image above you and your fellow ‘soldiers’.” Nick shook his head violently. “No! No no no! I don’t want to be the Devil! Take me back to Earth!” Hope gave Nick a look of pity. “The interview was voluntary. Not the position. You saw how weird it got. You chose to keep moving forward. You had opportunities to back down, but something kept you moving forward.” She studied Nick closely for a moment, before she faced the doors again. “Besides, you can’t go back to Earth. We’re far away enough from purgatory now, you should be getting your memories back.” “My… memories?” Nick wiped his sweaty brow. “Nicholas Uldson. Born and raised in the bad part of town. Couldn’t put your life together no matter how many times you tried.” As Hope spoke, a trickle of memories came in- each one weighing heavily on his soul. Hope continued. “You lived in a crummy apartment. It was a roof over your head, even though it was a leaky one. You and your neighbors were just doing what you could to get by. Your landlord had other plans.” At the mention of his landlord, Nick tensed. How could he have forgotten about Charlie? The amount of times Charlie increased the rent, while doing nothing about the bugs, mold, leaks, and rats, would send Nick’s blood pressure sky high just saying his name. “You remember him now, don’t you? Charlie? You and your neighbors were tired of the way he treated you. You could have gone to the police. You had piles of evidence against him, it would have been open and shut. He’d be in bars, and you’d get your justice.” Hope glanced out of the corner of her eye, without moving her head, to look at Nick. “He didn’t deserve bars,” Nick stated coldly under his breath. “Is that right? Ah, yes... the other tenants looked up to you. How proud you were of that. Couldn’t let them down, right? So instead of going to the police… you bought a bat. When the police showed up to Charlie’s apartment, and asked you to drop the weapon… what was it you told them as you stood over his mangled corpse?” Hope’s body shimmered for a brief second. “I was giving him what he deserved.” Nick’s memories were now a torrent, the years of being pushed around, of being told what to do, splashed against each crevice of his mind. “And in turn, they gave you what you deserved.” Hope shrugged. “So taking a stand makes me a bad guy, is that it? Fine!” Nick threw his hands up. “If I’m damned for tearing power out of the hands of those who don’t deserve it, then so be it! I wouldn’t take back ANYTHING I did in this interview! If what I did is wrong, then I don’t want to be right!” His voice grew hoarse as he yelled. “I’ll continue to show people the right path- that they don’t have to be subservient, or complacent! They don’t have to bend the knee to those who think they know better!” Huffing, Nick swung his head towards Hope, who was now fully facing him. “That’s the spirit.” She smiled, her body shimmering once more, before dissipating into motes of light. Nick stood alone in the descending elevator, left only with the sweltering heat, the memories of a life roughly lived, and a new job title.

Despite my failures, my successes, and everything in between, I always found myself functioning by the logic that things are chaotic and chance-based no matter how hard we try to deny it. In 1952 I was born to a wealthy couple who had inherited most of their fortune from some nameless relative. Inquiries into this matter almost invariably were met with quiet stares and mumbled dismissals. Father, with his meek tendencies, only ever succeeded at filling my head with naïve expectations of how to treat other people and fulfill obligations. Mother, with her stoic nature and unflinchingly cold hands, only saw potential in me through my ability to create things. Otherwise - as a son - I contributed very little to the well-being of the household. What with its sprawling marble floors and silent maids, what could I have? If I was not studying music theory, or painting, or sculpting with leftover clay, I had little to no interaction with the world outside my room. After my father’s suicide in ‘68, mother’s stoic nature turned from brusquely attentive to excruciatingly obsessive, criticizing my habits, my mannerisms, every little mistake I made. I had no doubt she showed only so much restraint against my spiritless father who undoubtedly would have crumbled beneath her at a moment’s doubt, and with his passing, decided whatever unresolved traumas she had been dealt was better off passed to me. The sleepless hours spent perfecting my strokes, the agonized morning hours toiling to clear my room of all personal organizations and projects, and the verbal chastisements were all tolerable to an extent. The beatings even, I could rationalize as just another form of a mother’s love. But when Mother began forcing me to partake in her nude studies, when I heard the sharp commands to join her on the stand and feel her curves, to explore her inner being, that’s when I knew love was dead. I still hear her coldly grunting in my ear while she rode me, that this is how the old masters would have become even greater than they already were, by “knowing” their subjects. This would continue irregularly until I was 20, when she finally agreed to one day let me attend a private art institute where I could potentially become a professor. Whether or not she suspected me a homosexual - as I never brought home a lady - I could not say, but I am doubtful that such a revelation would have impeded her transgressions against the flesh. The illusion of escape worked for a while. My peers and instructors were amazed at my body of work which was something of a combination between magic realism and classical antiquity paintings. I touched upon everything from life and death to morality and the soul, with a tenderness not often seen. And yet not a single one of them could see the pain in every single stroke. Had the likes of Bacon been around earlier, perhaps the patterns would’ve been slightly more apparent in my case. And one day, on the exact day I received a communique from the board of curators who reviewed my work for an upcoming exhibition, I was informed by the authorities of Mother’s death in the late afternoon. Dead from an unnoticed, underlying heart condition, found by one of our house servants. Would you believe me if I said I wept? I continued to do so even after being told I was scheduled to put my work on display in various metropolitan areas like New York, Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles. And with the passing of what little family I had left, the miniscule fortune of the estate was passed on to me. I would go on to explode onto the art scene and became a common name on the lips of every critic, every one of my contemporaries, my friends, my detractors. Fortune found her way into my bed. I had drug-fueled orgies every Tuesday. A most-definitely illegal cocktail every morning, afternoon and night. Studios destroyed by wild bouts of passion and crudeness, only to be completely redecorated and furnished the morning after. Looking down from an ivory tower at little people doing little things like hard labor and worrying about what's for lunch? Only 25. No time to ruminate when you were basting in your own - and other’s - juices. The years went on and as I rubbed elbows with this country’s elite, my work became somewhat more … vindictive. I started tossing dismissive, sneering messages into the paintings. Little jabs at the viewer’s intellect, hideous little doodles only perceptible from certain angles. And they ate the shit up. I remember one analytical take in a documentary describing a very obvious cock-and-balls superimposed over a commissioner’s visage as ‘a cheeky, playful and intimate gesture of the relationship between artist and audience.’ Complete horse apples. Why do these people pretend to be things they are not, I asked myself. Can they not see they’re the same as me? I started seeing my contemporaries as nothing but dogs in suits. No matter how vile, how macabre I made my work, all I got was laughter and admiration in return. All the while I’d look down and see the homeless below us, not even having the privilege to fuck or evacuate their bowels in privacy on the streets. Suffering while I was up here, consuming and indulging every sense I had just because I was slightly smarter than the rest of the animals. What was the difference, I ask of you. I forgot my name, my place in the world to the point I barely showed up to my own shows anymore. And to this point, my most favored critic - a man named Herbert Jones - would happily prey on my absences, listing my fatal personality flaws and elite lifestyle as reasons for my dips in popularity. On occasion, his attacks would cut dangerously close to the rumors about my relationship with my mother. Despite his lack of success in drumming up backlash, his existence was enough reason for me to realize he was right. I was one of the animals. My work had no more substance. I was floating in the water. That is … until I found IT. A thing, an instrument which, previously unknown to me, lay dormant in my grandfather’s old archives while searching for something to reinvigorate my passions. After years of rumination, months of sleepless nights realizing I was stagnating, I finally had the means to take back the beauty I used to see in everyone and everything. Even knowing how hard I’d been pushed by the loveless animals, I wanted to see it again. I invited the Critic to my home under the pretense I wanted his personal opinion on a new series I was vested in. And there, with the arcane capabilities of that object coursing through my entire being, I tore his physical body asunder, leaving only the tatters of his mind and soul flapping about inside a dark approximation of reality, for all eternity. It would only be later, after fleeing the city lights, that I realized a crucial fact about the human figure which my mother had beat into me early on. Before I recognized the flexibility of her philosophy of pain. Human suffering is an art form. The human body is a paint brush. True change occurs in the world when enough pain is reached that a threshold between the ideological and the physical world can be broken. Therefore, my work is an exploration into the changing of the landscape using that pain. As an artist, I am subject to the laws of my own changes; let suffering paint my being, and let my ideas contort the mind. Is that not the very point of art? To break, to remake; to move, and be moved; to feel, and be felt! Yes! Why, in this god forsaken, evil and wretched world, have we forgotten such a crucial and fundamental truth to the arts? Mark my words. They'll know real art. They WILL know it by the time I've turned to dust. But listen, very very closely. I can hear a growing chorus of murmurs and giggles above the rush of water and the distant sucking of city traffic. A throng of women approach from above, where the shadows of the bridge hide my form and what remains of my belongings. Something dazzles above their heads: not quite lamplight, but something else. Something metallic and pointed. I wonder: will they be my audience, or my newest piece? It doesn’t matter. None of it will matter. Written by William See Content is available under CC BY-SA"}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Rats", "title": "Untitled", "author": "bin.", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Animals"], "content": "I always hear these rats scratching in the roof when I try to sleep. It keeps me awake some nights, but other nights I sleep through it, blissfully unaware that they continue to rake their little claws across the roof all night long. I share a room with my twin sister, and she can never sleep through it. She often wakes me up, standing over my bed and whispering tiredly, “They’re doing it again, Kayla. The rats are scratching again.” I don’t really know why she always woke me up, though. I mean, we were only twelve years old, and it’s not like I could go out and buy a rat trap or climb into the attic myself and catch them with my bare hands. So we would walk down the dark corridor in a straight line towards my parent’s bedroom, and wake up my dad. He always knew what to do. He would put us back to sleep, and tell us that the next day he'd buy some new kind of trap to kill the ‘furry bastards’ with. Don’t get me wrong, I hate cruelty to animals. I think it’s probably one of the worst crimes imaginable, and I’d do anything to protect one. But when you’ve been kept up night after night after night with those diseased vermin scurrying their way through your roof, looking for god knows what up there, you would do anything to get rid of them. And when I say being kept up for night after night, I mean months. The rats in the roof had been there ever since my sister and I had turned twelve. The first time they made their existence known to us was the night we turned twelve. Their little tapping claws scoured the roof, their beady eyes looking for food in the darkness, their diseased bodies pushing over one another to find anything edible. We wanted them gone, and my dad knew what had to be done. This one time he bought these extra strength rat baits, guaranteed to kill a rat with just one nibble of the navy blue rectangle of poison. He climbed through to the attic, and into the roof where he lay the little death squares all around the place. Climbing back down through the manhole, he turned to us and rubbed his hands together. “Now we just have to wait, they’ll be gone soon,” then he walked past us and out of the laundry room. That night, we didn’t hear a thing for quite some time. “Dad did it,” I whispered to my sister, “he got them.” Though I still wasn’t entirely sure. Looking back on that now, I think that I said that more to reassure myself than to comfort her. As the night progressed, we began to hear the noises again, and I knew the rats hadn’t fallen for the bait. We would have to consult our dad again in the morning. I always thought it was strange how we never heard them during the day. Maybe that was due to the fact that it was quieter at night, and easier to hear them, or they just never came out during the day. Whichever it was, I didn’t care at the time, I just wanted them dead, and nothing was working. God knows how many different traps and different kinds of bait we stuck up in the roof. I bet anyone else who poked their heads into the attic would think it was a secret stash of poisons belonging to a serial killer. But we were just desperate to get rid of them, and they seemed desperate not to leave. Dad had eventually had enough, as understandably anyone would. My mum had begun to grow tired of his ‘money-wasting’ on all of the different products he had bought trying to get rid of them. She suggested that he climb into the roof and find out where they were coming from, and if any at all had died. So, drawing near to the end of his tether, he climbed into the attic with a torch. “You’re going to have to go all the way down to our bedroom, because that’s the only place they ever scratch,” my sister said as his legs disappeared into the thick blackness up above. We could hear him thumping and crawling his way along the roof all the way down the hallway. “Have you seen any dead rats yet, dad?!” I called, hoping the darkness hadn’t swallowed him entirely, drowning him and the sounds of the outside world. Luckily, it hadn’t. “Not yet. It’s weird; there isn’t even any evidence proving that there were ever rats up here. It’s really strange...” he trailed off mid-sentence, and I thought it would be best to let him concentrate. After a few minutes of thumping around in the roof, he crawled back out through the attic. No dead rats or traps or anything, except for an old, torn, bloodied t-shirt. “What’s that?” I asked. “I just found it; I’ve got no idea who it belongs to. Probably been accidentally thrown up there during a party or something,” he said as he threw it into a nearby bin. “That’s not the only weird thing either. All of the traps are gone,” he said, a serious look overcoming his face. “What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked him. “I don’t really know, they’ve just vanished,” my dad replied, a dumbfounded look upon his face. “I have to talk with your mother now girls, leave us alone for a bit.” He pushed past us and walked towards his bedroom. That night at the dinner table, mum and dad talked to us about a proposal they had in order to catch whatever animal was in the roof. It had to be intelligent to have gotten rid of the traps and bait. Dad thought it may have been a possum, but the only way to get rid of it was to make sure of what it was. “We’re going to place a camera in the roof and see what starts making those scratching noises. If we know what it is, we have a better chance of capturing it, okay?” Mum said to us. I couldn’t fault their logic. It seemed like a good plan. Up the camera went, into the swirling darkness. Dad placed it in the stretch along where our bedroom was located, seeing as that’s where most of the activity happened. He had put a sim card in the camera with twelve hours of recording time on it. Dad put the camera up there at 8pm, and would retrieve it at 8am. Then, it was just a waiting game. I heard the scratching noises all the way through the night, as usual. They started at exactly 9:24pm. I know because I checked the time so I would know when to fast forward the camera to in the morning. A pungent odor had also made itself known ever since Dad had found that T-shirt. It smelled like raw sewage, and my nostrils were always burning when I woke up. But considering we had no idea what we were up against, Dad couldn't do much about it. I couldn’t really get a wink of sleep, because I knew that the next day we were going to discover what the animal was and get rid of it. So I just lay awake all night long, thinking of the blissful days of sleep that lay ahead of me. At a little past eight in the morning, my Dad woke me up and handed me the camera. “Watch this and tell me what animal it is,” he said, turning to walk back out of my bedroom. “Where are you going, then?” I asked him, stopping him in his tracks. “The baits and traps mysteriously reappeared. I’m going to get a box to collect them and then head up there. Funny thing is, they’re right over your bedroom,” he said, giving me spirit fingers and exclaiming, “WOOooo! Spooky!” Then he laughed and exited my room. I shook my head and fast forwarded the footage on the camera to the exact time I’d heard the scratching. After a few minutes of fast-forwarding, the camera read 9:20pm. I figured I would rewind it to the point where the animal actually came into the roof so I might be able to recognise it better. One minute passed, then two, then two-and-a-half. I watched the screen intently to capture any kind of movement whatsoever. Finally, it made its emergence. Something that was curled into the fetal position in the far side of the corner began to move. Its spine was visible in the dim light, protruding through its pale yellow skin, almost the colour of off-milk. Its long and bony arms stretched outwards, and its skinny and impossibly long legs stretched downwards. Its limbs seemed too long for its body. Cramped muscles from lying in the same position for hours and hours finally got relief. Its body was spotted with blood, and it had a bloody rag on around its legs. Whatever it was, it was disgusting. But the scariest part was when it turned towards the camera. Pure black eyes the colour of coal stared straight into the camera. It opened its mouth in some kind of putrid grin, yellowing, diseased teeth peeking out from its mouth, desperate to escape. It was at that point that I knew it was a human. It crawled up to the camera, its bones visible through the thin yellow membrane acting as its skin. Its pure black eyes stared into the camera. Then it touched the lens, and I could almost feel its brown, rotting fingernails against my face. It turned from the camera, spit starting to drool from its mouth, and crawled over to the spot just above me and my sister’s bed. Then its face turned towards the camera unnaturally, and it began to scratch, staring at the camera the entire time. No, staring through the camera and directly at me. I couldn’t watch it any longer. I fast-forwarded the footage as fast as it could go, and it never blinked or looked away from the camera for the entire ten hours it scratched at the roof. Then it stopped, placed the rat traps that had disappeared the day before in front of the camera, and turned away and returned to the position it had come from. It tucked its impossibly long and skinny limbs into its body and curled into the fetal position. It hadn’t left, and now dad was up there. My heart jolted in my chest and fear overwhelmed every inch of my body. I heard a scream from above. Written by Natalo Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

He used to beg for change, but one day he started painting. He went to a recycling center or some place like that and collected old paint cans. Most of them still had a little paint left in them. God knows where he got the brush. He started painting on whatever garbage he could find: cardboard, paper, or whatever provided a flat surface. And he was really good, too. It was weird. He did landscapes, paintings of the places in the neighborhood, dogs, and some cool looking fantasy stuff. This guy was the damn Michelangelo of bums. He'd sell them for fifty cents or a buck. Then he'd use the money to buy some booze and drink himself into a coma. You know, a typical artist. Then he started offering to do portraits. No one liked them. I don't know why. I talked to a neighbor about it, who didn't really seem comfortable talking about it at all. She'd had one done by him and said it disgusted her and didn't look a thing like her. I asked to see it. It was beautiful, and amazingly lifelike. When I told her as much, she responded by slapping me pretty hard and telling me to get the fuck out of her house. She stopped talking to me after that. Nevertheless, I was so impressed that I asked him to do one of me. He said it would be two bucks. When I paid him in advance, he told me it would be done the next day. I passed by his usual spot the next day, anxious to see it, but he wasn't there. I was pissed for a moment. I thought he had ripped me off until I noticed something. Down by the side of the building was my portrait, covered, with my name and a note on it. The note simply said, \"Good luck.\" I uncovered the painting and was horrified. I looked distorted and misshapen. Sickly twisted in ways that made my eyes hurt. I was clearly dying in the portrait, if not already dead. Bugs and crows were feeding on me. I hadn't noticed one of the other neighbors behind me until he said, \"Hey, that looks good. I ought to get one done, too.\" He said it as he was passing and continued to walk on, but not before I got a glimpse of him. He was twisted and misshapen. He walked with a distorted gait. Crows and bugs trailed him, feeding on him. I looked around. Everyone and everything looked the way I did in the painting now. Everything I see makes my eyes water. Everything is horrible and ugly. Everyone tells me how beautiful my portrait is, and no matter what I do, I can't convince them that they shouldn't get one themselves.

We have family in some of the countries, but my mother and father really love the history and architecture of the region. Everything went normally during the trip. We ate good food, saw cool sights, and spent time with distant relatives. I acted like I wanted to go home the whole time, but truth be told, I had fun. My younger sister turned 14 on the trip. We had a big party for her. She was really into make-up and stuff, so my parents got her a bunch of foreign brands that are popular, I guess. As far as I know, it only started once we got back home. My sister started complaining about an itch. She said there was a weird tickling sensation constantly on her back. She’d always ask anyone (and I mean anyone , even strangers) around to scratch it for her, but was never satisfied. It was as though we just couldn’t get the right spot. It seemed very frustrating for her. My mother thought it may be a rash, or an adverse reaction to some of the products she got for her birthday. She saw the doctor, who said there was no sign of any problem with the skin, aside from irritation where she’d obviously been trying to scratch it herself with various objects. She went to see specialists. First a dermatologist, then an immunologist, even naturopaths. My sister, and the rest of us at that point, were getting desperate. About two months after we’d returned, it went from an itch, to an obsession. She was always scratching, all over her body. She said she could feel the tickle underneath the skin. As if “thousands of tiny bugs were crawling around her insides,” as she would put it. The closest thing we got to an answer was from a neurologist. He said that there could be problems with her nerves backfiring like crazy. He told us that there were certain medications she could be put on, but they’d have serious, and adverse effects. My parents were understandably hesitant, but she was in agony. We all agreed as a family, we had no other option. I watched her, getting worse with every day. The medication barely helped, and it left her in a severe mental fog. She had a hard time communicating and paying attention. The only thing she could do properly was scratch her skin. As her brother, watching her go through this was heartbreaking. I was helpless. I was supposed to look out for her, to defend her and take care of her. I was at my wits end trying to think of what the hell I could do. But if even the doctors have no idea, how the hell could I know? She stopped taking the medication, she said it was giving her uncomfortable side effects. She could “hear” the itching. She said it was better to deal with the irritating sensation, rather than the disquieting hallucinations. We all understood, we wanted it to be as much her choice as possible, with how to handle things. It was winter at this point, she’d been going for counseling and therapy. My father believed that this was some kind of psychological thing. That a psychologist would be able to help her “deconstruct the root of the issue.” It’s a good thing too, because if the psychologist hadn’t noticed, I don’t know if any of us would have. She’d been wearing heavy clothing all the time. We assumed it was due to the cold. As it turned out, her body was covered in lacerations. She’d been slowly trying to skin herself. She explained to my parents when the psychologist told them, “You don’t understand! Whatever it is, it’s inside of me! I have to let it out!” My parents were mortified. I was too. But I couldn’t help but wonder how she was able to hide it from us so well. I shared a bathroom with her, and I never found traces of blood that couldn’t be easily explained away. In the hospital, she was manic. Screaming, and flailing. Refusing to hold still, to let the nurse bandage her. “That's just going to keep it in!” she howled, desperately trying to rip through her clothing, to tear at her flesh. It was more than my parents could handle. She was sent to an institution, where they could keep an eye on her around the clock. She’d have no access to tools with which to harm herself, and she was forced to wear clothing that inhibited her from scratching. That was a week ago. Today we heard from the hospital. She’s dead. The doctors said they weren’t sure exactly how it happened, but at some point when she and some other patients were taken for a walk, she’d managed to impale herself on a fence post, through the throat. My mother hasn’t spoken a word since we heard the news. My father is furious. He demands to know how this could happen, when it’s supposed to be a “secure facility”. Me? I’m torn. As I sit here writing this, I’m devastated from the loss of my dear sister, but I’m distracted. I’m terrified, and I have no idea what to do now. I haven’t told anyone, especially not my family, but something has happened. A few days ago, I felt an itch. An itch I just can’t scratch… Written by Tewahway Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

I cannot hide it for much longer. With each passing day, it becomes more and more evident that I am different from everyone else. Concealing my secret for a short time was easy. I've always been regarded as the peculiar one in the family. The one who preferred isolation to the company of others. However, this is something else. This is something different, and my family is growing suspicious. I avoid any close contact with anyone I encounter, but as I pass, I see the sideways glances and curious stares that linger in my direction just a bit longer than usual. Some even reach out to me with words of concern and offers of help if needed, but I draw away. I don't let them get too close to me. They would know, without a doubt, that I am different and I am dirty! Once, there was a time when my entire world revolved around my mother. She spoke with such authority and strength, yet her voice was tempered with tenderness and affection. She could always be heard singing, and none could match her tone in sound or beauty. The beautiful melodies she created were the only reward I ever desired. It was all I ever needed. Until one day, I thought I heard the singing from another. For one brief moment, I listened to this strange voice instead of my mother. A momentary distraction, that's all it was. That was all it needed. Nothing is the same anymore. I go about my day and complete my chores.I do everything I am supposed to do, but it is different now. I am different. The sweet, soothing melody of my mother's voice echoes in the distance, but now there is another voice. This voice is dark and cold, and it clouds my mind and distorts my thoughts. It continually whispers to me from the darkness. At first, it was distant and far, but it grows closer with each second. It is so close that I feel its tongue flicking against my skin when it whispers. I cry out for help, but it restrains my speech. It takes control of my limbs and forces me away from the sight of others; my mother is completely unaware of my absence. I struggle with all my might, but it overpowers me and manipulates me like a puppet on a string. One leg in front of the other, it marches me out into the forest beyond the safety of my home, granting no rest or reprieve. Farther and farther away I go, the voice of my mother fades in the distance. Overcome with fear, I fight frantically to regain control of my body, and it answers my struggles. It sternly makes it known; it is much, more than just a mere voice in my head. I can now feel it moving. The pain in my skull is causing flashes of light to explode in front of my eyes as I shuffle onwards. It halts my body in an unfamiliar place, deep within the forest. An invisible hand forcibly grabs the back of my head and slams it to the ground. It pries my mouth open to an abnormal width and clamps my mandibles down on the long stem of a large and green leaf. I feel the muscles in my six extremities being severed, making them useless and immobile. Its impatience to be free from its prison can be felt in its writhing and squirming. Its body slides and presses alongside the inner surface of my skull. The pressure and pain build, and the lights grow dim before my eyes. Darkness falls over my eyes, and the chill of the forest floor creeps over me completely. Stillness and silence settle heavily upon me. Suddenly, I think I hear faint singing coming from the distance. It’s a melody I know very well; a tune often sung by my mother. It takes away all the fear and pain of the moment. I begin to hum along to the comforting lullaby. Darkness falls completely with the explosion of a fleshy, wet stalk emerging from the top of my head. The creature emerges from the shell that was its womb, glad to be rid of the vessel, now dead at its feet. It reaches up towards the sky, like the phoenix of old, and basks in its own magnificence. It is always invigorated by its rebirth. It will now begin to grow; that is all it needs to do. In time, its spores will appear and start to fruit all over its body. The spores are separate but still of one mind and one body. They will leave this place and travel on the currents of the air and cross the lands near and far. They will search and listen for the voice of another royal mother. Their only desire is for her children to listen to its song instead of hers. Just a single moment is all it needs. O. unilateralis is a specialized fungal parasite that infects, manipulates and kills formicine ants. It has been referred to as the: Under the control of the fungus, the Infected ants are forced to abandon their colony and travel along the forest floor where they will clamp themselves to the underside of a leaf and remain until death from the fungal spores emerging from the head of the ant.

He felt not only the foreboding presence of a hazardous blizzard, but also that of something else. Something darker. It felt as if it resonated not only within his soul, but also within the souls of those around him, within the very ground itself. Patrick had never bothered to check, but he was sure that beneath the grass and soil of Winter Harbor, Maine, there in hungered a gaping mouth or a chasm yearning for the flesh of the innocent, and anchored to the physical world only by a desire to seem normal. It had not yet been appeased because the residents of Winter Harbor were all but innocent. Patrick had moved to Winter Harbor hoping to escape the despondency and despair he had felt in his hometown, Belmont, Maine. So far these feelings had only amplified, magnified, by both the wintry death that he felt tip toeing in the town’s midst and the lingering scent of paint that seemed to permeate every building in the city. It was as if the town was constantly being repainted in some sort of halfhearted attempt to cover something up. Still, he felt it necessary to stay, so as not to make matters worse for his wife, whom he barely saw anymore, and his son, who always seemed so distant. He and his wife were going through a rough time in their marriage and their son was feeling its effects. It was akin to what one may feel after a tumultuous earthquake. Patrick felt that he had to make it up to his son, so he went out and bought him the most expensive and extravagant thing he could get his hands on this late in the shopping season, a brand new video game system. He had assured his son that, even though he had acted out often this year, Santa would bring him something good. Throughout these charades, Patrick felt empty at the prospect of shopping for a boy that he knew nothing about, a boy whose existence was forgotten every so often. On the Eve of Christmas, Patrick arrived home before the snowstorm and quickly crept into the garage to wrap the present and place it under the tree. It was in this garage that he often felt abrupt changes, as if within its small space, it contained secrets beyond human comprehension. The musky smell of the old holiday decorations coupled with the omnipresent scent of fresh paint, varnish, and gasoline all seemed to meld into one personified force, whispering sweet nothings to Patrick as he exited his car. This caused him to shudder heavily, as if beset by a fit of delirium tremens. He shrugged off the dull headache and dry mouth before quickly and sloppily wrapping the gift. Following this, he slipped it under the tree and began to creep upstairs. He couldn't help but grimace at the thought that he was as far from Santa as humanly possible. As he reached the top of the landing, Patrick glanced over at the clock. It read 11:49. He stood there, as if to wait for some fleeting childhood feeling that may accompany the arrival of Christmas. It did not come, as he soon found. Nor did cheery music, nor the scent of evergreens and cookies. Just deafening silence and that damnable scent of paint. It was everywhere, inescapable. The arrival of yet another disappointing Christmas struck Patrick like a blow to the face. He fell to his knees then subsequently onto his stomach. He couldn’t tell if he had passed out or not. Suddenly, a loud sound in his son’s room jarred Patrick awake. He quickly got up and stumbled into the room. The popping sound he had heard made him wonder what made it, and when he finally found out, he was confused even further. A large, black humanoid, adorned with goat horns and a tongue that writhed like a snake, stood before him, clutching his son. Patrick stood dumbfounded, seemingly incapable of recognizing not only the creature, but anything else before him. “What do you want?” Patrick asked. Innately, he knew that the creature wanted something. The creature smiled, licking his lips. “Thine tender fruit, not spoiled by the worms of new but by the tree that bore it… ripened not into ambrosia but a rotten, hollow core…” Patrick stared at the creature. Sweat began to collection on his brow. He felt as if his brain itself had been lit afire. He couldn't breathe. “I… I can’t say I understand…” Patrick stammered out. The creature smiled again. “Not by love of a dying star can a a planet be adorned, but by the eruption of its most sacred peaks? I desire the treasures from which you hope to find salvation. The gift to your boy. It is a gift for me, now.” Patrick couldn’t understand why the creature would want the game system, but he felt it necessary to give it up. He quickly bolted downstairs, grabbing the box and, clutching it tight, he sprinted back up to his son’s room. The creature, upon his arrival, thrust Patrick’s son to the floor and held out one long, beckoning hand. As Patrick handed over the present, he couldn't help but feel as if he were Faust himself, exchanging an eternity for one single moment of gratification. The creature licked his lips once more and disappeared in the time it took Patrick to blink. When he was sure he was alone, Patrick fell to his knees and wrapped his arms around his son. He expected a “thank you,” an “I love you,” something. He heard nothing. He looked down. He found that his son was withering away, becoming the very shadows that inhabited the night around him. Patrick knew at that moment that he was entirely alone, swallowed finally by the chasm beneath his feet. He stumbled to the garage before sitting down, embracing his solitude and his communion with the musky smell of paint that seemed to beckon invitingly."}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Package_Marked_%22Return_to_Sender%22", "title": "Untitled", "author": "Unknown", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Reddit Pastas"], "content": "My neighbor is one of those annoying wannabe YouTube personalities. Over the years, I’ve seen him cough out cinnamon, lay flat on the hood of his car as it slowly creeps down the driveway, and douse himself in lukewarm water, all the while screaming epic win, epic fail, or, fuck, epic maintenance of the status quo, for all I know. It can get tiring to watch him go about his shenanigans in the pursuit of viral fame. So, when he knocked on my door the other day, told me he was going away for a few weeks, and asked that I get his mail, honestly, it was a relief. I can’t explain the peace of mind I had knowing I didn’t have to brace myself for any of his stupidity for a while. I was always afraid his stunts would wind up bleeding over into my life. Things were pretty normal for the first couple of days. He received a few bills, a bit of spam, and what I could only assume was a birthday card. Then, one evening, I got home to find a cardboard box waiting on his front porch. In big red letters was written “Return to Sender”. I’m no small fry, but I admit I had trouble lifting the box on my own. It was really freaking heavy. Lugging it across the road to my house was even harder, and I quickly realized there was no way I was going to drag it up the stairs and through my front door. I decided I’d leave his package in my garage. It wasn’t like I kept my car in there: the garage door was a piece of shit that refused to open without a good thug and a whack. It was less trouble just leaving the car in the driveway than it was to fight with the garage door every morning and night. In hindsight, I should have set the package down while I struggled to open the tricky door, but you know how it is when you’ve got a good grip on something, no point in setting it down if you don’t have to. It was as I kicked the door for a third time that I lost my grip on the package, and it fell to the ground. I heard a light crack inside. “Shit,” I cursed. I hoped I hadn’t broken anything important, but figured I just wouldn’t tell my neighbor about it and let him assume the break happened en-route. Hands free, I finally managed to get the garage door unstuck, and boy did it screech in protest as it rolled up and over me. I dragged the box the rest of the way, setting it in the corner for whenever my neighbor would come back to claim it. And then, I forgot all about it. Until a few days passed, that is. I’m not sure exactly how long it took for the smell to waft in from the crack under the garage-to-house door, but it came in in slow progression. It was a sickly sweet odor similar to a skunk, and for the first few days after I smelled it, I genuinely assumed that’s exactly what it was: roadkill that had left its mark on my house. It was only when I realized the scent was growing more intense instead of fading that I went looking for a source. That’s when I opened the garage door, and that’s when the odor knocked me back, holding my nose. The culprit wasn’t hard to identify. The only change in my garage was the box in the corner. I remember thinking it must have been one of those meat-of-the-month subscription boxes. The meat must have gone rancid from being left out of the fridge for so long. How much meat could have been in there for the box to have been so large and heavy? An entire freaking cow? I covered my nose as I approached the box, a pair of scissors in my hands. I probably wouldn’t have needed them to open it, as it had become soggy enough at the bottom to poke through with a finger, but I wasn’t about to poke my finger into spoiled meat juices. That soggy bottom was the reason I had to open the box in the first place. If I tried to drag it out whole, everything would spill onto the floor. I was going to have to dump the pieces of meat one garbage bag at a time, and take them down to the dumpster, a process I wasn’t looking forward to. My scissors tore through the tape along the top of the cardboard box. I thought the smell couldn’t get any worse, but as I flipped the flaps open, I discovered a whole new gamut of stink. It was like opening a burning oven, but instead of a heat wave, I was met with waves of piss, sweat, shit, and putrefaction. It was so bad that I staggered back and had to force down the puke begging to guzzle out of me. I don’t think I could have handled that scent mingling with the horrors coming out of the box. I’m not ashamed to admit I ran out the door for a breath of fresh air, but in the short time I’d spent in the garage, the smell had become so ingrained in the fabric of my clothes that it clung to me like a shadow. Nothing I tried could keep the smell out of my nostrils. Not air fresheners, not a face mask, not three showers and a change of clothes. Every second that box lay open in my garage was another second the smell was allowed a foothold into my home. I had to bite the bullet. I returned to the garage, the flaps of the box still open as though inviting me to look. I was prepared, a clothespin pinning my nostrils shut, a garbage bag in one hand, the strongest cleaner I could find in the other, and long rubber gloves to keep my skin from having to touch what was inside. But, as it turns out, I needed none of those things. I wouldn’t have to touch or clean the contents of that box, I would only have to suffer the nightmares every night. You see, there was meat in that box, but it didn’t come from a cow or a pig. No, it was worse than that. It was my neighbor. Dead. Still in one piece, but dead. I called the cops, and naturally, they took me in for interrogation. It’s kind of hard not to suspect the man with a corpse in his garage, after all. Thankfully, they soon realized I wasn’t involved. My DNA might have been all over that box, the smell might have left a mark throughout my house, but there was one piece of irrefutable evidence in my neighbor’s own hands that proved my innocence: a vlogging camera. They showed me the footage only once. I’m not sure if they were allowed to, or if they felt so bad for me they figured it couldn’t hurt. Either way, I saw it. My neighbor was sitting in the box outside of a shipping facility, laughing as he told the world how he was going to mail himself across state lines. He’d brought pee bottles, food, a pillow, and a few flashlights. His friend – a guy I’d seen at his place several times to help with his stunts –, closed the lid and presumably dropped him off for shipment. Throughout the next couple of hours…or days, I’m honestly not sure, my neighbor recorded a few short clips about his progress. ‘I think I’m in a truck now, I can feel it moving’, ‘Must be in a warehouse. Pretty warm here. Still got plenty of food!’, that kind of stuff. And then, on the last entry, the box toppled over. He broke his neck, and that was it. The camera recorded until either the memory card got too full, or the battery died. There’s one thing I didn’t tell the police after they showed me the video. One thing I heard in the footage that will haunt me to the day I die. Just after the tumble that broke his neck, I heard the familiar screeching sound of my garage door. Credited to manen_lyset"}

{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Package", "title": "Untitled", "author": "anyone at any moment", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Items/Objects", "Reality"], "content": "I know this may sound strange, but please, you must listen to me. It is of the utmost importance. One day, you may hear a knock at your door when you are home alone. If you check to see who it is, there will be no one there. There will simply be a package. Just a plain package: no markings or labels of any sort. Not even a shipping address or name. Just a standard package. You will look around for a mailman making his rounds or a UPS truck driving away, anything to explain the appearance of this package, but there will be nothing. When you come to this point. Just stop. Turn around, go inside, watch TV, surf the Internet, anything to get your attention off the package. If you don't, your curiosity will get the better of you. Under no circumstances should you open the package. Just leave it outside on the doorstep, don't even touch it, or you'll be further tempted to see what's inside. Don't worry, within the next half hour if you go outside, it will have vanished without a trace, and you'll never see it again. You may live the rest of your life not knowing what was in that mystery box, you may even openly express regret for not taking a peek. Don't worry. It's not worth the trouble. For if you do open the box, you will find nothing. Except, of course, a small piece of paper. On that piece of paper will be a sentence, simple but utterly unsettling: \"You opened the box. You shouldn't have done that.\" For the rest of your life, you will be looking over your shoulder, questioning whether or not people are following you. You will forever be unable to feel safe or comfortable in one place for too long. You'll know that you have invited something into your life, but you'll never figure out quite what it is, and that's the most maddening part. That you will never know. You will constantly feel like you could be attacked and killed by anyone at any moment, even those you love. You will cut contact with everyone you know and die, alone and terrified. And why will you do all this? Because that note implied something terrible would be fall you, it drove you to paranoia. You'll probably initially try to brush the note off as some dumb joke, but I ensure you it's not. And you can trust me, do you know why? Because I am all too familiar with how this crazy cat-and-mouse game works. In fact, I know that there's a package waiting outside your door, right now, as you read this block of text. I haven't had the chance to knock yet, but I'll let you know a secret: I'm watching you from a distance, as I've watched many before you. I see you now, as you read this article. Don't try to find me, you never will. I'm good at hiding, you see. I've been at this for a long, long time. That feeling I said you'll get, the one of paranoia and near constant terror and panic. Well, there's a reason you'll get it: I'll be watching you; watching and waiting. After you've cut contact and are sitting in your remote home alone, unable to sleep out of a mix of horror, depression, and paranoia, I'll slip silently into your home. I'll be wearing all black, wearing a doll's mask, carrying a silenced pistol, with a surgical saw, gag, handcuffs, gasoline tank, flare, and plastic bag in my car. Your death will be quick and painless; after the years of psychological torture, I owe you a dignified and merciful death. Then I'll go to work on your body; I'll dismember you and stuff you in the plastic bag and then dump you in a river and set your house on fire. Your family will hear of your disappearance, and hold a funeral with no corpse to bury. I'll be there, too, sitting in the shadows, paying my respects. For you see, I'm no monster; I can do good by my victims. I'm not insane, just bored. So go ahead, go outside, find the package there. I love seeing the look of surprise on people's faces when they see that it's really there. If you follow my advice from earlier, you're one of the smart ones; don't let curiosity kill the cat. However, if you brush it off as some sort of demented, elaborate prank, and eventually open the box, you'll regret it. I know what you're thinking as your read this: \"This is definitely just a sick joke. There's no box outside, and if there is, there's no way all this is going to happen. I'm stronger than that. It's a joke, that's all.\" And you're probably right... Then again, you might not be... I guess you'll have to find out for yourself. The choice is yours."}

I did it because she was cheating on me. Ok, so I didn’t have any tangible proof, but every time she came home, I could smell the cologne of other men on her. Try putting yourself in my shoes, slogging through the door after a hard day’s work and giving your wife a kiss only to inhale the scent of another man on her clothes. I mean, so what if she worked in the cologne department at Macy’s? That’s not an excuse! She was cheating on me, I tell you! And I had enough of it! Nobody cheats on Phineas P. Woldsworth! That’s not my name, but nobody cheats on me, either! The point is, the bitch had to die. I’ve never murdered a person before. I guess I always pictured it would go more smoothly. In the movies, when someone gets their throat slashed, they bleed a little then usually die a neat, instantaneous death. Quick and clean—that’s how it was supposed to be. I snuck up behind her after she had fallen asleep on the couch watching Real Housewives of Timbuktu (or some other vapid reality show) then opened up her throat with a kitchen knife. She gushed like a geyser. You should have seen it! I didn’t know a person’s body could hold so much blood! I’m not ashamed to admit, I got a little lightheaded from the sight. Well, it certainly wasn’t a neat kill… and it wasn’t a quick one either, for that matter. My wife fell to the floor after I sliced into her neck and began to wildly thrash her arms and legs. I’m sure she would have been screaming too if I hadn’t done a number on her vocal cords. It took about a dozen more stabs to her windpipe before she finally stopped moving. I was kind of disappointed when I realized that the knife I used was a wedding present from my late Aunt Carla. She was my favorite Auntie, and that damn thing held a lot of sentimental value to me, but now I had to get rid of it. There was no way I was going to keep the murder weapon in my house! That would be crazy! Once I was sure my wife was finally dead, I looked around the house to survey the damage. Both our bodies and half the living room were completely coated in blood. I dragged her into my bathroom and dumped her body in the tub. The mess took hours to clean up, but I think I did a bang-up job. I got that living room looking like something you’d see Martha Stewart bedazzling throw pillows in. All I have to say is thank goodness for hardwood floors! It would have been a hell of a lot harder if we had laid down carpeting like my wife insisted when we first moved in. I patted myself on the back for putting my foot down and nixing that idea. After I was done cleaning, I went back inside the bathroom and tried to figure out what to do with her cadaver. I always do my best thinking on the can, so I popped a squat next to her and began to make a number two. What? I didn’t think she was going to mind. I was just beginning to breech when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. Her stomach had begun moving—heaving up and down at an alarming rate. It startled me so much I nearly fell off the pot. Was she breathing? I felt a wave of guilt begin to wash over me. How selfish of me not to turn on the vent! A second wave smacked me in the face, but this time it was fear. How could she be alive? I thought to myself. She must have spilled enough blood to fill a dumpster! I tried to reassure myself that it wasn’t what it looked like. I remembered once reading in a magazine that gas can escape a body, sometimes hours after death. This can give the appearance of breathing, but does not actually mean that the body is doing so. Just as my heartbeat was beginning to return to its regular cadence, I could have sworn I saw her fingers twitch. The sight made me want to get up and sprint as far away from the house as possible—turtle head poking out of my crack and all! A scene from an old television show jogged my memory, allowing me to collect myself. In it, a crime scene investigator explained to a plucky young police officer that even though a person’s brain may be dead, their body’s muscles can still twitch for a little while after they pass. See? I thought to myself as I pushed a little harder, trying to coax the chocolate bunny from its hole. There is always a logical conclusion for these types of things. Sometimes things can't be explained, though. I realized that when my wife turned her partially detached neck towards me and opened her eyes. The look of rage on her face made me want to scream, but I was too terrified to make a peep. She opened her mouth and I’ll never forget the sound of her gurgling voice as it reverberated off the bathroom walls. “LIGHT A MATCH!” PLOP. Credited to Vincent Vena Cava"}

I suppose chasing one", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Reality"], "content": "I am what many would perceive as the luckiest man on Earth. Well, maybe saying something such as this is a tad hyperbolic. I'm no jackpot winner, but I do have my fair share of blessings. So, let's contextualize just how fortunate I have been over the years, shall we? I say we start at the beginning. Like, the very beginning. Yeah, we're going a long way back for this. When it comes to my mother, it's very easy to say that she had no redeeming qualities in any way, shape, or form. While carrying me in the womb, her top priority was not me, but rather drinking and consuming a rather large quantity of drugs. She lived a nomadic lifestyle which could be explained by her constant financial struggles. I suppose chasing one's desires and allowing temptation to be that which governs life is more appealing to some than creating a safe environment for a future family. What I'm getting at here is that I survived despite the many, many chances that I wouldn't. When I ask myself how favored I have been throughout my life, my birth is, of course, the first thing that comes to mind. Things do not stop there, however, because of several complications that would present themselves in the future. For one, I had severe asthma throughout my childhood. I frequently reminisce of the plentiful times where I had to carry a machine with me to breathe. I often had to miss many days of school due to my excessively weak immune system. I was very prone to disease, and when I became sick, it would take me far longer than average to recover. Life progressed, as did I. Although my health had increased, I cannot say the same for my intelligence. Yeah, that's a knock on myself, but I can't call it unjustified considering the number of times I risked my life without even recognizing it. From poking a fork into an electric socket to tying a fishing line around my wrists tightly, I certainly wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. Well, I would assume that by now the point has been made about my blessings. It's a strange thing to look back on, you know. The memories I have of my thoughts and feelings of those times; they all juxtapose my current situation. Having the cold, metal barrel of a gun against my temple sends shivers down my spine. I feel so overwhelmed by the sentimentality and stress I feel coursing through my veins. The past and present collide together, sparking a fire within my head. My fingers claw through my tangled hair and lip quivers nearly as fast as my intensely beating heart throbbing in my chest. I need to swallow the lump in my throat and collect myself. I need to breathe deeply. I need to wipe the tears from my eyes and the sweat from my brow. Look, all this thinking isn't for nothing. It's not like I'm invulnerable. I've been cut and bruised and bombarded by the ones I love. I’m no stranger to feeling vulnerable and damaged. The only question which resides within my mind now is this. Why me? It is my hope that this note will provide you, and perhaps myself, with the answer to the madness which has engulfed my life. The memory of the night it happened is hard to remember for me. I recall stumbling out of the pub as the moonlight illuminated the parking lot. I shouldn't have started the damn car. Even I could smell my horrendously intoxicated breathe as I shut the door behind me. I sloppily adjusted the window mirror, its smooth, gleaming surface giving me a glimpse of myself. The dark rings around my eyes and the glossy, scarlet coloring of my sclera were very telling of my state at that time. Yet, with the turn of a key, my ignition roared, and off I drove into the night. I couldn't tell you how long I rode along the rural road that evening. The glimmering stars in the sky turned to a blur as my vision and hearing turned fuzzy. The landscape was desolate aside from the trees which swiftly passed me by. Strange, isn’t it? How rapidly a situation can completely devolve into something horrid. One second, I was traveling alone in a secluded area, and a blaring horn and brilliant light flooded my eyes and ears the next. After that... nothing. I don't remember the impact, only darkness which quickly enveloped me. Upon regaining consciousness, the first thing I noticed was the crimson blood that smeared my steering wheel. My hands clenched the door handle tightly, and with all my might, I pushed the door open and crawled out of the vehicle. My palms pressed against my head and my knees shuddering; I ogled the scene displayed before my eyes. Compared to the damage done to other car and its driver, my suffering was nothing at all. The small van that I collided with was bent inwards in the front, its windshield completely shattered. I stumbled my way over to the passenger side and peered inside the window. Within the car sat a young woman, her head leaned back in her seat. Her mouth sat slightly open, and her wide-open eyes were glossy and rolled back, devoid of life. Glass shards pierced her body, soaking her clothes in the blood that leaked from her wounds. Her nose had been smashed and pushed back into her skull. Chunks of flesh that had once been on her face now remained on the leather steering wheel. A sickly yellow vomit erupted from my throat and splashed onto the road. My stomach would empty itself for several minutes, each heave and lurch taking the oxygen from my lungs and bringing about a stream of hot tears. They dropped onto the pavement along with my insides, and this kept up until all that remained within my gut was air. My head pulsated from the pain that I felt, as if a mallet was being bashed into my cranium non-stop. Whether this was brought about by what was left of my hangover or the grotesque scene before me, I do not know. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I tried to turn it on, but it was dead, and I knew that the road that I was on was so dormant that it might take the rest of the day for help to arrive. Clenching my jaw tightly shut, I turned back to the vehicle before me, eyes darting around to avoid seeing the corpse once more. I could see a phone on the floor by the passenger side of the car. Walking to the other side of the car, I curled my sweat-drenched fingers into a fist and began to pound on the window. After a few strikes, I broke through the glass and was able to reach the phone. When the police arrived, the alcohol was pretty much out of my system. While the accident was deemed my fault based on circumstantial evidence, the charges I faced were nowhere close to how bad they should have been. I of course sent my best wishes to the girls’ family, but it wasn't enough. No amount of retribution could ever mend the hearts of the people my actions had wounded. I didn't attend her funeral. In fact, I couldn't even bring myself to ask the family if I could have. How could I face those who surely despised me with every ounce of their being? Such a thing is implausible, to say the least. So, what did I do? I tried to let such memories fade into obscurity. A fruitless trial of course, but my cowardice and inability to face what I had done and who it effected plagues me in every waking moment of every day. I should have done better. I wish I had done better. Yet, I didn't, and it's too late to change that. As I write this, I look down at my right arm. The scars and bruises I received from breaking that window cover the surface of my arm. They exist as physical reminders of the deep emotional cuts that still haven't healed. The gun still sits beside me on my desk, and I can't help my straying eyes wandering over to it. The thought of using it on myself is tempting, but I shouldn't. Not yet, anyway. You see, I don't wish to end my life because of the accident, or any specific actions I have done at all for that matter. There's something else. Something more compels me to try and take my life. So please, allow me to further explain my predicament. Fast forward a few years, I came home from work to find my front door unlocked. I gripped the doorknob and swallowed the saliva which coated my throat. I had thought that maybe I had simply forgotten to lock the house up before I left earlier. After conjuring comforting explanations in my head, I gently pushed the door ajar and place one foot inside my home. As soon as I entered the living room, my jaw practically dropped to the floor. everything was in disarray, from papers spread across the floor to chairs moved and knocked over. I took a few steps forward, slowly treading further into the room. I stopped dead in my tracks, holding my breath. One of the footsteps that landed on the polished oak floor didn't line up with my own. Another step was taken. It wasn't mine. When the blade entered my back, it shredded through my tissue and went down to bone. My jaw catapulted open and a shriek akin to that of a banshee escaped my mouth. I collapsed to the floor, hitting my head against the table leg. I looked up at my assailant, and he stared into my eyes. In front of me was the visage of a man with pure hatred stitched into his expression. His pupils had dilated beyond what I thought was humanly possible. He charged me and knelt on my stomach, burying the blade deep within my chest with one swift motion. My head threw back and I screamed bloody murder. I desperately reached my hand up and clawed at the man's face, and in retaliation, he repeatedly slammed my body against the floor. At that moment, I thought it was over, that my life would come to a violent end. I could no longer feel the pain then as I had prior. I felt numb, and all I could do was look into those maddening eyes. I would die a life of mediocrity and regret, where the remembrance of my time on this Earth would be deliberately forgotten as the steady marching of time continued. My eyes closed as the depressing thought of the end of my days consumed me. Suddenly, I heard a sickening crack. The fingers that had once held such a strong grip on me faltered, and soon I had been released. Reality rushed back to me, and I pushed myself away from the man who was now sprawled across the floor, a grimace stitched into his face. A large pot had fallen from the top shelf of my cabinet and onto his head, causing him to bleed profusely from his scalp. His knees shook as he tried to find his balance. The agony I had felt resurged, and I held my tongue firmly to stifle my cries. Now back on his feet, the man methodically made his way towards me, swaying side to side and extending his arms in my direction. I was confronted by a myriad of possibilities at that moment as a surge of questions came to me at once. What would he do to me? How could I stop him? Do I have a chance at survival? A disgusting sloshing sound produced by the man walking through the pool of blood that sat where I once was caught my attention. He instantly accelerated towards me, but in his quick burst of speed, he slid on the slippery surface and missed his target. His body fell into the wall and the force repelled him back, crashing to the ground. A fresh puddle of gore emerged where he fell. His neck had landed on the spot where the knife lay, and the serrated edge had gashed his throat. I made my way towards and took off my shirt, attempting to create some sort of bandage for him. I knew he had tried to kill me, but despite that and my serious injuries, I tried my best to save the man's life. I didn't want to deal with yet another cold carcass in my sight. I looked into his eyes once more, and the anger that I had previously seen in them had been replaced with sadness. His blood was oozing through my shirt and trickling onto my hands, and the color was draining from his face. With every breath he took, his chest rose less, until the movement was hardly noticeable at all. He raised his hand to my collar and softly gripped it, expending almost all his energy in the process. His lips parted, and he spoke to me, his voice faint and dry. \"Why couldn't you have just stayed off the road, asshole.\" His voice trailed off and his eyes closed. I couldn't react to what he said, nor could I move a single muscle. The lifeless body in my living room fell from my arms as I stared into the void, my mouth agape. Memories of that fateful night flooded back to me once more, and my entire body shook with such a ferocity that I had not imagined possible. My nose felt clogged, my lungs congested. I gasped for oxygen that my body had begun to deprive me of. I felt light as a feather, yet the weight in my chest carried the burden of an anvil. As sudden as my descent into panic had begun... it ended. The pressure faded away, and I collapsed to the floor, bloody and bruised. With all the might I could foster, I grappled for my telephone and called for help. Many hours and stitches later, my doctor entered the room where I was resting. He approached me; a smile plastered on his face. \"You're a very lucky man, you know. The stab wounds you sustained were bad, but nothing fatal. If the blade had entered your body only a few inches further in either direction, you wouldn't be here today. It's very fortunate that you're alive.\" \"Yeah, just my luck,\" I responded. I didn't care to say anything else, for the man's final words were all I could think of. Looking back on these moments, I lifted my shirt and grazed my fingers along the scar along my back. The texture is different from the rest of my body. Another injury, another reminder of why I'm making this note. Even still, I need to face those thoughts and finish this writing. It's odd how different our perspectives will be upon reading this text in the future. I think, after many months of retrospect and research, that you what may find as a suicide note is to me a text which serves to record my life so that I may look back on it, if my theory about my good fortune is to be true. My life both draws near to its end, and yet it will only continue from here. I suspect this is not the first time such a thing has occurred. It is, however, the first time I shall document it. It sounds contradictory, I know, but something tells me that I might not be too far off the mark. I can feel the pain swelling within me, and not just in the form of emotional torment. I feel physically ill. My ribs are visible through my rough, leathery skin, and my arms have grown weary just from this minute amount of writing. I sleep twelve hours a day on average, and that doesn't include the various naps I take throughout the afternoon. I need to finish this quickly, so I think it’s time I write candidly to you about my latest plight, and the reason why I ultimately believe I need to go through with my \"suicide\". I've been diagnosed with terminal cancer. When the news was revealed to me, I didn't know how to feel. I thought I could make it through this. I've always made it, haven't I? No matter the odds, luck was always in my favor. This offered little comfort to me once the pain began to gradually increase, however. My will to eat, drink and work has greatly diminished. I took off from work of course, because what's the point? Most people would use this opportunity to spend as much time with their loved ones as possible. They would make a bucket list of everything they have ever wanted to do and fulfill those goals. That was my impression of what one did when they knew they had limited time on this earth, anyway. I suppose my expectations were wrong. I don't currently do any of those things, because all I can do is sleep. I rest and eat a small portion every day and spend the rest of my time watching the television. I don't waste away and expect pity out of it. I don't need any condolences, because although my life has had plenty of pain that I brought onto myself, dying with regrets is not what I am afraid of. I sit in my chair, my fingers spread across my keyboard. I cup my hands and breathe into them, and then move them to my nose and take in the stench of my stale breathe. I haven't brushed my teeth in weeks. My shower has remained dormant for just as long. Motivation is lacking, morale is low. Yet I type and type, detailing my experiences for all to see. My eyes dart across the room to the clock. It's later than I usually stay up, but this is important. What can I say? I have a message that needs delivering. I don't think my plight is solely my own. My luck is beyond that which any man, woman, or child could ever experience in this world, but I don't think that's a coincidence at all. My mind is beginning to race again. All the people I initially met. Everyone I've spoken to, and everyone that I've seen. I am dead to all of them, and in a way, they are dead to me. How can I wrap my head around all of this? It's just my luck to have survived through situations where I should have died, right? I should have been a cold corpse six feet under by now, and yet here I am. The most blessed man on earth, huh? My body aches, as does my heart. I hold my withered hand up to my hand and rest my elbow on the flat surface that I sit before. The lights have faded, and all that illuminates me now is the computer screen. What's the point of living anymore? Am I here to rot, and forever be haunted by my past? There's no rhyme or reason at all. No purpose for all these happenings. It’s as if the world is doing what it can to keep me alive. Three months. That's how long it has been since I was supposed to die. I've been told it can happen any day now, yet somehow, I doubt that. Such a thing would be a miracle at this point. I can see my gun reflected on my computer screen. It's getting harder to resist thinking about it. Those who read this might feel that these are the final words of someone with more than a few screws loose, but I feel like I have some sort of obligation to warn you that I don't think I'm alone in this experience. There's nothing extraordinary about me. Perhaps this is something that everyone will experience. The ability to survive against impossible odds. No human could go through the things I've been through and live to tell about it. I don't think our minds can comprehend everything that we experience. Think about how many times you've had a near-death experience. Is it reasonable to presume that we've all just been so fortunate as to endure beyond what anyone could, or is there something more? As I've discovered, some refer to these phenomena as the quantum immortality thought experiment. The notion that since our brain cannot comprehend what comes after death, our mind is instead transferred into another universe where our deaths simply never occurred. I know it's only a thought experiment, but... could this be what is happening with me? Everything that has happened can't just be luck, can it? Is the universe keeping me alive and hiding the truth from me? Is it doing the same for all of us? I clench the weapon within my hand once more. My finger is lightly placed on the trigger, and I think I'm almost ready now. For all my speculation as to how and why, in truth, I don't know that my suspicions are correct. I need to test this theory to reveal what is truly going on. This is perhaps the end of the line for us, dear reader. For me, it may not be. If I am to be correct, then the same can be said for you. God, how I wish I could dispel my fortune. What is there to live for except the melancholic prospect of suffering in one's pity and pain when there are no consequences for one's actions? No ultimate ending, no finale to the story of our lives. It is now time for me to part with you. Remember the different perspectives we shall have regarding this documentation. I truly don’t know if I’m right about this. Maybe I’m completely wrong, and this is the end for me. Maybe I really was just the most fortunate man in the world. Whatever the case, this is something I need to do, if for no other purpose than to discover the truth about my life and our reality. Well then, let's test my luck one last time."}

Me and my friends were out every Halloween night when I was young. We collected candy and had a good time. Like every other kid. But I'm 11 now and I've stopped collecting candy on Halloween. Let me tell you why: When I was 10 years old, me and my friends were getting dressed up. We had heard that there was a serial killer on the loose, but we didn't care. We couldn't let this night go to waste. We all had normal goofy Halloween costumes. When we went to the first door, an old woman opened up. She looked in horror as her eyes widened. She began hyperventilating as she said, \"Go-good costume...\" We were confused, as even we knew our Halloween costumes were bad. She gave us some candy and we left. Even then I should have known something was up. But I couldn't let this night go to waste. We went towards the next house opening the door, a middle-aged man saw at us as his jaw widened, \"Jesus, don't scare me like that!\" he said. We looked at each other as one of my friends said, \"What do you mean?\" \"It's just a very good costume!\" he said repeating it, whispering to himself, \"Nothing more...\" He gave us a lot of candy. We were happy, but somehow I couldn't shake the feeling of dread off me... weird. We went towards the house at the end of the street, where a crazy woman lived. We were scared as we opened the door, but we gave in when we remembered how much candy she had. \"Hello!\" she said. My heart was pounding. \"Trick or Treats!\" we shouted. She only stared. It was almost as if somebody was breathing on my neck. \"Good costume!\" she said. \"So, how much this time my little... boys...\" We looked at each other, because we didn't know what to say. \"A lot?\" I said with hesitation. \"Do... You really think you deserve that?\" \"No...\" one of my friends said. \"I'm joking,\" she said. \"That's the best costume I've ever seen! Have candy!\" I couldn't hold it anymore, so I asked, \"Whose costume?\" and she replied with, \"The guy in the serial killer costume behind you.\""}

The doors to the homeless shelter shut in ten minutes, but Caleb needed another drink. It was Christmas Eve 1970, and he was wandering the streets of Eureka, California in a tattered and filthy Santa suit, crimson hat perched atop his head, dirty beard pulled down around his neck, a streak of vomit running down his left leg. When the Salvation Army gave him the costume, days ago—how many now? Three? Four?—it had been brand new and shiny clean, but he had gone AWOL as soon as he had begged up enough money for a good drunk. He couldn’t believe how easy it was to get money begging in a Santa Suit during the holidays, especially when people thought they were giving to the Salvation Army. Too bad, he thought, that the racket had to end tonight. Fuck it, he was headed to the nearest bar and had a pocket full of money. Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright. Oh what fun it is to sing a sleighing song tonight. Finally managing to make eye contact with the simian faced bartender who was absent-mindedly pushing a dishtowel up and down a pint glass, Caleb waved a fiver in the air, a wry smile of what the fuck? on his face. Red and green Christmas tree lights flickered over the bottles and mirrors and off in the corner the Ghost of Christmas Past grinned its horrid smile. The bartender nodded acknowledgment and strutted over. “Yeah? Whaddya want?” “Beer and a whiskey.” “What kinda beer? What kinda whiskey?” “The cheapest.” The bartender got him his drinks, took the twenty, and left his change in front of him on the bar. Sipping the bitter medicine, Caleb noticed a woman a few stools down trying to draw his attention, a jet of blue smoke issuing from her cherry-red lips as she raised and lowered her thickly-penciled eyebrows. He could tell she had done her best to look good tonight: lots of eye makeup, newer, hipper-looking clothes, but he could see the age in her face, recognized her need like a bad smell. Battered, needy women gave off a stink of desperation he’d learned to recognize over the years. Those years since he’d been back from the war. He’d had his fair share of these types. Always good for a warm bed and a hot meal, but too crazy to spend any real time with. “Hey there, Santa. Buy a girl a drink?” “Sure thing, honey.” Caleb glanced at the barkeep. “Give the lady what she wants.” She slid down next to him as the grim faced bartender mixed a rum and coke, speared a lime with a tiny sword and dropped it in the glass. “I’ve always had a thing for Santa,” she whispered. “Coming in late at night to punish the naughty and reward the nice.” “Yeah, and what are you, darling? Naughty or nice?” “I’ve always thought I was a little of both.” “Ha. What’s your name, baby?” “Sandra. They call me Sandy around here. But I think of myself as Sandra.” “All right, Sandra. What’s your story?” “Just a local girl, been in the same place too long. What about you, Santa? Don’t you gotta lot of work to do tonight?” Caleb laughed, that deep, reassuring laugh he’d mastered over the years, to put people—women especially—at ease. They talked for a while. Then Caleb ordered a pitcher of beer and a couple more shots and they moved to a corner booth. Sandra talked on and on, chain smoking Salems while he drank his beer and sipped his whiskey, watching as the room began to spin in slow, psychedelic and nauseating circles. “You’re awful quiet.” “I’ve been told that before.” “How’d you get them scars on your neck?” Caleb put his hand to his neck, let it drift down to the dirty fake beard, and pulled the knotted grey and black mess of hair over to cover his throat. And that wicked Ghost of Christmas Past with sunken eyes and yellow teeth whispered, “Tell her.” And so Caleb did. “In the war.” “You were over in ‘Nam, huh?” “Yeah, two tours.” “And then what? You come back to have these damn hippies spiting at you? I feel for you, sweetie. My daddy died in France fighting Nazis. Now my brother is in the Navy while this country goes to shit. You got these bastards like that dirty Abbey Hoffman saying to steal everything. And this Charlie Manson Family killing movie stars.” She laughed, shook her head and sipped her drink. “It’s enough to make you sick.” They grew quiet. “So, you going to tell me about those scars, or what?” “Well, I was a Kootchie Kootie. A tunnel rat. You know what that is?” “Oh, yeah. You were one of those guys that go down in those gook holes?” “Sure was. Infantry. 1st Reconnaissance Squadron.” He sighed, not wanting to get into it, but once he started it was hard to stop. “I was working three clicks west of Duc Pho in the Quang Ngai province. I was down in a tunnel. Just me, my .45 and a flash light. Looking out for booby traps and rats and spiders, and this animal. . . it came out of nowhere. Fucking attacked me. Just latched onto my shoulder and wouldn’t let go.” “Oh, baby. You was attacked by an animal down in one of those tunnels?” “Yeah. But when I killed it, when I shot it . . . ” He couldn’t tell her the rest. He couldn’t tell her how after he had shot that thing, the muzzle blast a blinding light, the report deafening, after he had filled that monster full of holes and watched it drop, it had looked just like a little girl. Just a tiny, raven-haired girl, all shot up and bloody, when moments ago it had been a beast: a mess of lurching fangs and drool. His mouth moved up and down silently. He couldn’t say anything. Then, with an incredible effort, what he had managed to say was, “I think I brought something back with me. I . . . I . . . I don’t know.” “You brought something back with you? You mean like that agent orange stuff, honey?” “No, something different. Something, something. . .” “What? In your head?” He wanted to say, no, something in my blood: I brought back something in my blood that makes me a monster; but instead, he just nodded yes, his face a knot, visibly fighting to not break down in tears. “Oh, baby, oh, baby, I understand.” The room was twirling now at a breakneck speed. He was going to be sick. He pulled away from her and vomited on the floor. “Son of a bitch!” the bartender shouted. “Who’s going to clean that up?” Caleb hung over the edge of the booth, retching and dry heaving. “Fuck you, Sam. He’s a veteran! He fought for this country, got attacked down in one of them gook holes. What the fuck you ever done?” “I don’t care if he was on the beach at Normandy. Get him the fuck out of here!” “You’re a piece of work. A real piece of work, know that, Sam? Where’s your sense of Christmas spirit?” The bartender stomped up to her, eyes bulging, an accusing finger extended. “Get your cheap-whore ass out of here, bitch, and take your Santa Claus friend with you. Got me?” he grabbed her face in his hand and jerked her chin up so that he could look her in the eye. “This bar ain’t no place for you any more, Sandy. You make my customers sick. Everyone who’s wanted to has fucked you, and none of them’s too proud of it either. You'se don’t belong here. Find some other place to haunt, you cheap skank.” With that he tossed her head aside and stormed back behind the bar. We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Sandra walked Caleb back to the motel room she rented by the month, holding him up the whole way while he leaned against her mumbling and pointing to ghosts she could not see. Once they were back at her room she helped him out of his Santa outfit and got him into the tub. In the heat of the steamy water he regained a semblance of consciousness, came back to himself. When he looked up he saw her through the mist, leaning in the doorway, staring at him. She had changed and was now wearing nothing but a silk kimono. He had to admit she didn’t look that bad. “How you feeling, Santa?” “Good. I feel . . .” he paused, unsure what to say, how he actually felt. “Good.” She knelt down beside the tub, ran her finger over the surface of the water. “Thirsty?” she asked, holding up a tumbler of Scotch and water. “As a matter of fact, I am.” Taking the glass into his hands, he took a sip. Handing it back to her she gave him a penetrating stare that he found hard to decipher and then leaned in to kiss him. She tasted of whiskey, cigarettes and peppermint. But it was good, the way she gently ran her tongue over his upper lip before she pulled away, and Caleb felt himself growing aroused. “Now that you’re all cleaned up, why don’t we get you to bed.” “Sounds good, baby.” “Dry yourself off. I’ll be waiting.” With that she disappeared out the door. He got up from the tub and dried himself the best he could with the cheap, tiny towels the motel provided. When he entered the room she was already on the bed, prone on her back and naked. She may have had a butter face but her body was to die for, and she knew how to flaunt it. He started towards her but she held up her hand, palm out toward him, and exclaimed, “Stop right there, mister. The Santa suit. Put it on.” He gave her a questioning half grimace and then smiled. “You serious?” “I told you: I gotta thing for Santa.” Smirking, he pulled on the dirty jacket and set the conical hat atop his head. “Better?” “Oh, yeah, baby. I’ve been so naughty. I need to be punished.” With that she burst out in playful laughter, turned over onto all fours, and stuck her ass into the air, whispering over her shoulder, “Come and get it, Santa.” He approached the bed and, still standing, he pulled himself into her. She let out a deep moan and he began to move, slowly. He was still drunk as hell and the room was spinning slightly but he could feel that primal urge within to rock and rotate. He began to lunge faster, and faster, and then, suddenly, it was happening again. Fuck. No. No. No. It was happening again . He could feel himself beginning to change as he thrust against her. A part of him wanted to run away, to bolt through the door and into the night so that he wouldn’t hurt her. But another part of him wanted this. It felt good. It felt so fucking good to let go and let the animal inside him take over. Still pounding, Sandra moaning beneath him, he watched in wonder as his fingers—tightly gripping her bony hips—became claws and a thick mat of fur began to weave itself up his arms. Thrusting against her with all his might he lifted his face and began to howl as his mouth filled with sharp, gleaming fangs. Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus lane! Margaret Ashton was the manager of the Lone Pine motel. She had been across the street visiting with her daughter and grandson in their two-story, cookie-cutter house, and she was just walking back to the motel office when she heard the screaming in room 308. It was that cheap-tramp Sandy’s room. Margaret had been waiting for an excuse to evict her and marched up to the door, ready to throw her out, Christmas Eve or not. But as she grew closer and heard the urgency to the screams, the gut-wrenching terror of the squeals, she grew hesitant and stopped. Suddenly, without warning, the window shattered, showering her with glass and splintered wood. She fell back and slipped to the ground, watching in utter disbelief as the craziest thing she had ever seen in her life of fifty-six years came tumbling down atop her. It was a wolf. A huge monster of a wolf, with a snarling mouth of fangs dripping blood and drool. And it was wearing a red coat lined in white fur with a Santa cap perched atop its head. From his bedroom window her grandson Tommy watched the entire thing. Later that night homicide detectives would interview the little boy. Tearfully he would relate how he had seen his grandmother ripped to shreds by some kind of beast in a Santa suit. One of the uniformed officers standing idly in the background would then turn to his partner and whisper under his breath, “Looks like grandma got run over by a werewolf, walking home from his house Christmas Eve.” God, the Easter Bunny, and the Ghost of Christmas Present watched as two-year-old Annabelle toddled out the door of her street-level apartment and onto the sidewalk, a thumb stuck in her mouth and dragging a Barbie doll along by the hair. God looked like the guy from the Dos Equis commercials: an incredibly good looking older gentleman with white hair, perfectly coifed, and a nicely trimmed beard, in a tuxedo. The Ghost of Christmas Present looked extremely bored and kept yawning. The Easter Bunny was an out-of-work writer who needed a shave, dressed in a pink bunny outfit. “Cute kid,” the Easter Bunny commented. “I wouldn’t get too attached,” the Ghost of Christmas Present replied, disinterestedly stifling a yawn. Annabelle’s parents were fighting again and they could all hear their voices echoing out from the apartment. “Just how many Quaaludes did you take? You can’t even look at me. Jesus, wake up, bitch, I’m talking to you.” “Fuck off, Henry. You always were a bore.” “You dumb c*nt. I oughta slap the stupid right offa your face.” When the wolf came galloping down the middle of the street in its blood soaked Santa suit the Easter Bunny turned to God and said, “You gotta be putting me on, man.” God rolled his eyes. The wolf grabbed the baby in its mouth and threw the child upward into the night sky where she hung suspended in the moonlight for a moment, tiny arms and legs kicking, and then tumbled down, landing on the street with a thud. The beast leapt at her, sinking its fangs into her neck and thrashing its head side to side until the tiny figure ceased to struggle and lay limp in its mouth. “It’s probably for the best,” the Ghost of Christmas Past said. “What? Why?” the Easter Bunny asked, scratching at the stubble on his face. “You want to tell him, God? Or should I?” God gestured with his hands, as if to say, “Go ahead. It’s all you.” “If Annabelle had lived through this night, after being molested by her stepfather and stepbrother, she would have become a heroin addict by fourteen and a prostitute by fifteen. She then would have gotten picked up by a notorious serial killer who after raping her for days would finally kill her by trying to give her a lobotomy with a cordless drill. Her life taken like this, quickly and mercifully, is a blessing, a thing of joy. A Christmas miracle.” “Is this true?” the Easter Bunny asked God. God grinned and nodded. “You don’t say much, do you?” the Easter Bunny asked God. God just shrugged. Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la. ‘Tis the season to be jolly, fa la la la la la la la la. Father Mulligan was cleaning up after midnight mass when he heard the click-clack of claws on the wooden floor. He paused, chalice in one hand, ciborium in the other, and listened. “Hello?” he called out, his voice echoing throughout the empty chapel. “Who’s there?” Beneath the pounding of blood in his ears he distinctly heard panting, like that of a large animal. “Hello?” Deep in the dark recess of the hall something stirred, moved, and then came slinking out of the shadows: a large creature walking on all fours, its eyes alight and flickering like yellow flames. The beast came forward slowly down the aisle, Santa hat drooping down one side of its head, a dead baby hung limply in its mouth. The wolf approached the altar and came so close that the priest could smell it, a feral odor of blood and musk. It spit the baby to the floor where it landed with a horrible smack. But the priest didn’t run. He stood his ground, murmuring prayers beneath his breath. He knew why the beast was there, why this spawn of evil had come. It was here to punish him. Punish him for the things he had done to all those little boys. So many. First in Ireland when he had just been doing what had been done to him when he was an altar boy. Then, after coming to America, in Philadelphia, where for years the urban darkness of poverty and city life had let him run rampant. Not yet here in California, where he had been sent quickly by the diocese so as not to cause a scandal. But he had his eyes on a few of the boys in his congregation. Some of the poorer ones who he thought wouldn’t tell. Seeing the monster here was a blessing and death would be a mercy. He fell to his knees, kissed his stole, and lifted his neck to the beast. But instead of taking him by the throat, the beast spun him around by the shoulders so that the priest fell face first to the floor. With one quick jerking motion the monster shredded the priest’s pants and mounted him. The priest cried out in pain and surprise as the wolf forcibly entered him and warm blood began to trickle down his leg. God, the Easter Bunny and the Ghost of Christmas Present stood at the back of the chapel watching. The Easter Bunny had taken off his hood of rabbit ears and was puffing on an e-cigarette and furiously tapping away on an iPad mini. “Been blogging about this whole thing, and, yeah, a lot of people see that as offensive. I mean, what the fuck? You got a werewolf dressed like Santa Claus raping a child molesting priest on Christmas Eve?” The Ghost of Christmas Present laughed heartily. “Well, I hate to say I told you so, but . . .” “You got nothing to say about this, God?” the Easter Bunny asked, momentarily looking away from his iPad. God tilted his head to the left, his thin lips bending into a sad frown, and, raising his eyebrows in an, “Oh, well,” manner, shrugged again. Joy to the world, the Lord has come. Let Earth receive her king! Gravy Brain Jane was out of her mind on LSD and had nowhere to go. She had a thousand tabs of purple sunshine on her but the connect had never shown and wasn’t answering the phone. Exasperated and befuddled, her vision a swirling cyclone of light and darkness, she stumbled from the Greyhound Station to a small clearing in a copse of woods. She sat leaning against a tree, the branches dripping and melting around her, the sky a miasma of spiraling stars and galaxies. She giggled and mumbled, “No sense makes sense,” to herself. Charlie had sent a message from prison that she should deliver the acid here. If Charlie said it would work out, it would work out. She was sure of that. She had thought the other passengers on the bus would have been startled and scared by the X that Sandy and Squeaky had helped her burn into her forehead with hot bobby pins, but no one had noticed at all. The Easter Bunny, who wasn’t even wearing his rabbit outfit anymore, and was now just dressed in his usual black jeans and t-shirt, was pacing back and forth irritably. He turned to the Ghost of Christmas Present and asked, slightly argumentatively, “Well, where’s God?” “Oh, he couldn’t make it. Had a concert to catch.” “A concert? What are you talking about?” “Well, it was Skynard and you know how he loves Free Bird.” “Typical.” Gravy Brain Jane giggled when she saw the beast slowly creeping towards her. She had been taught to love coyotes when the family was in the desert of Death Valley. Back on the ranch Charlie had taught them to break down the final walls society imposed on them by having them fellate the stray dogs. “Hey there, beautiful,” she said. The wolf just stared at her with its unblinking yellow eyes. From their glimmer and spark she knew just what the creature wanted. It wanted what all men want and she had been taught the ways of a free love society. Giggling she squirmed from her panties and lifted her skirt with a vacant grin. She knew that in love there is no wrong. That submission is a gift and that you should never learn not to love. Charlie had taught her well. She spread her legs, exposing herself, and the beast crept up to her and lowered its snout to her and began to lap at her in quick, greedy, licks. She gripped his ears tight, her head thrown back, and thought about how groovy and sexy it was to be pleasured by the beast, to have death and life so close, to lay your hands upon the monster and be free in love. As she bucked and lurched and felt herself climax she thought about how the Son of Man had taught her that death is only another orgasm, that everything in the universe is in and out and in and out in a cosmic orgy, babies coming out, galaxies sinking into black holes, knives plunging in, blood pouring out. Wow! Talk about the Big Bang! The beast crawled atop her and slipped itself into her. When it shuddered and released itself inside her she knew within her heart that she would be with child. This was a happy moment. A glorious moment in time. Another Christmas miracle. Oh, joyous night. She would name this child Stewart, Stewart Kirby, after her grandfather. Afterwards, the beast lay against her, spent. She stroked its fur with her nails and gently kissed its blood drenched snout. In this way the beast kept the girl warm through the coldest hours of the night. Silent Night. Holy Night. All is calm. All is bright. Free in the moonlight as snow began to fall, bathed in the stink of congealing human blood, the taste of flesh and woman fresh on its lips and tongue, the lycanthrope ran, the stars above him a smear of spilled milk, the moon a cataract eye aglow in malignancy. On the First Day of Christmas my true love gave to me. . . Caleb awoke in the morning naked and freezing, enveloped in the scent of the Douglas fir and redwood. He shivered and looked about. Snow was falling heavily, blanketing the earth in white. Beside him lay his tattered Santa costume, by some miracle the hat still clung to his head. He glanced above the towering tree tops to the shelter of the sky and saw there a light both majestic and bizarre. Seemingly fake, like a bad special effect from a cheap television show. And in that glaring gleam of white, he saw a black figure descend: The Ghost of Christmas Future who spoke in a deep and sultry voice while extending out a hand, “Do you wish to come with me?” In his mind all he could hear was Bing Crosby crooning I’m Dreaming of a White Christmas , and a million worlds passed before his eyes. Birthday cakes with only a few candles to blow out. His mother’s smile as she tugged on thread, sewing patches on a Cub Scout sash. Playing catch with his dad who bought him that special glove for little league and would oil it with him in the falling sun of the suburban evening. Watching Kennedy’s skull explode on television, Jackie screeching and trying desperately to crawl away. The Howdy Doodie show. Lee Harvey Oswald grimacing in pain and turning as Ruby put a bullet in his side. That gnarled old apple tree in the backyard, how that ancient tree would fill with tiny white blossoms in the spring so that you could not tell how old and bent it really was, its age hidden in its blooming. How those tiny petals fell in early summer, glistening in the amber light, a shimmering rain of flowers cascading down and lying white as snow on the ground. Sweat streaming down his brow as he pushed a lawnmower, that smell of fresh-cut grass, such a vibrant green it made his head hurt. Behind the baseball dugout with Betty Connors on a warm summer night: his first kiss. How she had moved away soon after and he had never seen her again. His draft card: that plain and innocuous envelope of a pale yellow color that they’d all dreaded and all expected. Telling his father, “Guess I’m going to war, pops.” And his father just nodding back stoically. His gal Sally, with her beehive hairdo, who wouldn’t let him fuck her no matter how hard he begged and pleaded, telling her he didn’t want to go to war a virgin. The ancient apple tree in autumn, loaded with ripe fruit. The bumpy ride over the Pacific in a military transport plane. The Vietnamese whore who spread her legs for a single American dollar. Paddy fields burned and incinerated so that no water stood within them and the rice stalks withered. January 1968. Tet: The New Year, a time to worship ancestors. An intricate barrage of hellfire. Medivac choppers stuffed with bloody men and boys. Fire fights, flares illuminating the night, the thunder of mortars and sparks of muzzle flash. A landscape of smoke and exploding ordinances. Those mornings when the bombers flew in and the ground shook like jelly. Seeing men he knew dancing and screaming in flames. Splintered, broken trees, smoke billowing in the distance. The Pickle Switch and canisters of napalm. VC bodies dressed in black lying in horrible piles. A rifle on the ground with a stream of ammunition dripping out of it. “I dare you to pick up that dead man’s gun.” “Yeah, right.” The tunnels. And the idea of winter, just the concept of it in that hot, hot land where all is hidden from you, taken, and there is nothing to believe in or hope for, but you imagine that tree back home nonetheless, barren and without leaves and fruit, draped in snow and frozen. The way the men whispered when they found a dead body, till all you hear is whispers of body, body, body. Then the beast appears who is really only a little girl. How could you have thought that a little girl was a monster? There was no monster, just a little girl, you made everything else up. But now there is a monster, just as sure as there are ghosts, an Easter Bunny and a God. It’s you. You’re the monster. You’re the beast. And you think to yourself, “What have I done? What did I do?” Then, as you face this ultimate truth, the cold takes you. And when would spring come again? Certainly not in this lifetime, and not on this earth. So, “Yes,” you say to the cold and the winter. To the Ghost of Christmas Future who holds nothing forth but death. “Yes. Take me. Just take me away and let me be free.” An affirmation to end the rest of your negations. And you let go of that aching, awful, agonizing pain of being a man of flesh and blood, the cold slowing down your heart, and give in to death. And as you slip away, into the embrace of the Ghost of Christmas Future, you wonder, “Was it real? Was any of it real at all?” And in the heavens a laughing God finally breaks his silence and answers: “There is no such thing as real. It’s all just a dream within a dream.” Written by HumboldtLycanthrope Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

I was deathly afraid of goblins. Neither of my parents, siblings, or any doctor or therapist could put two and two together to figure out why I had this strange phobia. I actually asked my dad about it last year, and he said that my phobia was called Bogyphobia, the fear of demons and monsters. I asked him about this, because I wasn't afraid of demons or monsters, just goblins. I hated those short, hairy, ugly little creatures. My dad said that it may have been the cause of reading too many scary books, or that a certain video or picture may have sent me into a state of shock. I hadn't remembered seeing anything like the things he mentioned, and he must have known that this was what I was thinking, because he said that there was a small fairytale book I used to always read when I was younger, and I was so incredibly afraid of one of the pages that I would start to cry when I looked at it. He remembered reading the book to me, and I started screaming and sobbing when he reached that page. So I asked my father where the book was, and he said that it was probably somewhere in the basement at my mother's house. I groaned just thinking about that place. It was so dank and disgusting, and nobody ever cleaned it. But regardless of how I felt, I made plans with my mother to go over there and spend the day. But instead of sitting in the dirty living room, watching some terrible movie, I snuck into the basement. But as soon as I reached the bottom step, a horrible odor hit me. I nearly puked, it was so gross. I looked around through my watering eyes to see if I could find the source of the smell. And I honestly wasn't surprised when I saw rotting dog and cat feces, damp, dirty boxes, and a mountain of dirty laundry that the dogs and cats had used as their personal pee-absorber. I ran back upstairs and took a deep, long breath. The air wasn't clean up there, either, but at least it was better than downstairs. After another long breath, I ran back downstairs, covering my mouth and nose with my shirt. I didn't know where to start. There were so many boxes. Just so, so many. I poked around in them. Old hats, baby clothes, broken toys, and finally, old, childhood books. I started taking them out of the box, one by one, paying attention to the titles so I wouldn't miss 'Rapunzel'. And there, at the very bottom of the box, was the old picture book lost in a mess of mess. I looked over it carefully. The gold tin lining around the outside of the book was torn and dull, and the cover was damp and dirty, but it seemed as if the pages inside of it were perfectly clean. So I took the book back upstairs, not bothering to clean up the other books, and ran to my room. I was so glad that I had found it, yet so scared to look through it. What if that picture brought back terrible, horrible memories, or I developed Bogyphobia again? Oh well. I felt a strong need to look through it, and I had spent so much time looking for it, that I didn't care. But I decided that I would read it when I was back in the clean safety of my own home. But then I realized that my mother would probably see me carrying the book, and take it away, or worse, throw it out. So I had to sneak it out of the house. I concealed it in my hoodie, and everything went better than expected. When I was back at home, I drank three glasses of water and ran up to my room, hiding myself in the closet with only a flashlight and the book. I was so excited, I could feel my hands throbbing. I carefully opened the book. I didn't want it to tear or break, after everything I went through to get it. I read each line, looked at every picture, until I got to the page before the one thing I had dreaded so much when I was a child. I took a few deep breathes, pondering on whether I should look at the picture, and risk my phobia coming back, or just shut the book now and sit there, hours of hard work being wasted. Screw it, I thought, and I turned the page. I squeezed my eyes closed, and my brain started pounding against my skull. Horrible, dreadful memories came flooding into my brain all at once, like an almost endless river. I could remember myself crying and screaming, the horrible nightmares, the terrible laughs that would remain in my head for such a long time! I forced myself to open my eyes and look at the picture again. And suddenly, it looked so familiar. The short creature was dancing around a small log fire in what appeared to be some sort of cave. He had this horrible look on his face, like screaming and laughther at the same time. His nose was long, and his eyes went different ways. It was horrifying. I shut the book and stepped out of my closet, and into the safety of my warm bed. The book sat straight across from me, and, being so afraid of it, I threw one of my pillows at it. It fell over, revealing the torn back cover with words that I could barely understand even though they were so big. I couldn't look at that book ever again. I wrapped it in paper and folded it into five plastic bags, and hid it in the darkest corner of my basement. I never wanted to see that menacing little goblin ever again. The nightmare I had so many times when I was a young girl were not of the horrid little demon in the book. It was about a goblin, yes, but not the same one in the book. my dream took place at my mothers house. When the dream started, I would somehow know that it was going to be the nightmare, because it would start off as just inky black darkness for a few seconds. The I would be in the old bunk bed in my old room. It would be midnight, and I would literally just float down the stairs. The whole house would be dark, but I went to the front door anyways. It was blocked by old 1990s VCRs (I still have no idea why), but I would always somehow manage to move them out of the way and get onto the green front porch. By this point in the dream, I would remember that my mom, dad, brother and sister had left me alone at home to go to a party. So I would go into the garage. Keep in mind, like I said, it was very dark, except I could see through a dim light. In real life, the driveway at my mother's house is very long, but you can still see the road and people walking by through a grove of trees. Back in the dream, the driveway was the same way. Then I would see this strange, short black shadow walking along the side of the road. And then It turned into my driveway. I had to say this was probably one of the worst parts of the dream, seeing that creepy black shadow just sauntering towards me in the darkness, when no one was around. And it kept walking towards me, until it was about an inch from my face, and I could make out it's features clearly. Now that I think about it, this goblin was very similar to the one in the book, except this one had a very scary cackle. Then it pushed me, and I fell on the ground, squirming in pain as it beat me with a broom. After about 15 minutes in dream-time, he would stop, and I would be out in the garden with him, and he would force me to dance and sing a song about how great he was. Then, he would say something about knowing where my parents were, and he would be pulling me up the road in a red wagon. Then the dream would end. I'm not sure, but when thinking about it, he may have been taking me to hell. The dream alone was just awful, but this element alone is so dark and creepy. I also remember there was another version of the dream, where I get out to the car before my family leaves, and they bring me with them. And when I look out the car window, there was the little goblin. Only he wasn't cackling—he was just staring at me with those terrible eyes. And he wasn't happy."}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Nightmare%27s_Reality", "title": "Untitled", "author": "a train or murdered with a chainsaw", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Dreams/Sleep", "Mental Illness", "Disappearances"], "content": "Shortly after her father’s death, the nightmares began. These were not your everyday nightmares. Not the usual falling, finding yourself in school in your underwear, no. These were much more vivid, more terrifying and disturbingly real than your average bad dream. Willow seemed to be completely paralyzed. She couldn’t move or try to touch anything. The whole time she was dreaming everything was disturbingly silent for the most part, except for the occasional blood curdling scream. Horrifying images of the disfigured flashed before her. Among the slideshow were children with missing or mangled limbs or torn abdomens; adults killed in gruesome ways, such as hanging. Every time she had this dream, it ended with her, strangely enough, hearing these words: I love you. She had no clue as to who most of these people were, but some of them seemed vaguely familiar. She recognized one boy, for example, who was consistently in the dreams. He was around eight years old, and she frequently saw him with his mother on the train she took to her high school. She had picked up that his name was Jonathan. Willow knew it was him due to one distinguishing feature: the noticeable half circle scar that ran from right under his left eyebrow to his jawbone. When she saw him in the nightmares, it always seemed like he was among the worst of the disfigured; sometimes looking like he was run over by a train or murdered with a chainsaw; but she could always see that scar. She also would see some of her acquaintances that Willow ran into from time to time, the checkout girl at the local convenience store, an elderly man she saw at church, a handful of her classmates, but no one she knew particularly well. This had all started almost a year ago, on her sixteenth birthday. This dream haunted her almost every single night, with slight variations. She hasn’t told anyone about these dreams, and she isn’t planning on it. Although this goes without saying, she dreads the night more than anyone could imagine. The worst part, she couldn’t force herself awake from these dreams. Willow had no choice but to endure the duration of these plaguing nightmares until she heard those words. When she did, she would wake instantly. She woke up every day with a headache. Then she turned seventeen. The night before that particular birthday, the nightmares were particularly horrifying, the images even more vivid. She emerged from sleep with a jolt, tears streaming down her face. Willow lifted the covers off of her with trembling hands, almost losing her balance as she stepped on the ground. One hour later, the high school girl boarded the train that she took every day. Taking a seat, she noticed that Jonathan wasn’t there. She saw only his mother, who seemed to be sobbing to herself. Concerned, she walked up to her. “Miss, I know I don’t know you too well but I’ve seen you around. May I ask what’s wrong?” “Oh, of course dear,” the woman said in a raspy voice, enhanced with the German accent Willow never realized she had “My boy, Jonathan, he’s missing. Me and my husband, we have searched for three days now. We called the police, but they have no idea either.” The young girl was shocked. Jonathan had been in her nightmares that night, more so then usual. The images were as vivid as ever. Willow snapped her eyes shut and brought her hands to her face, a sad attempt to push the images out of her mind with no success. Even though it was about eight o’clock in morning, she saw the boy like she did in the dreams. Behind her eyes, the video flashed before her like it had so many nights in the past. The Voice of the mother surrounded her, as this poor woman was frantically asking if she was okay. It’s not every day some high school girl has a mental break down on a train. Willow snaps out of her panic attack, and faces the woman. “Sweet heart, are you okay?” She said. “Um… yeah, head rush…” Willow stuttered. Luckily, the train came to her stop. Willow went through her day at school in a daze. The “flashback” type episodes like the one on the train occurred in spurts throughout the day, even though this had never happened when the sun was still up. Needless to say, she was terrified with the sudden escalation. That night was like any other horrific night. This time, however, she saw one person in particular- Her Geometry teacher, Mr. Han. He appeared to have been hung in this dream, and by the looks of it he had been stoned or savagely beaten beforehand. The next morning while Willow was going from home room to English, the intercom system blared: “Attention juniors and seniors, Geometry class has been cancelled until further notice. Mr. Han is absent for unknown reasons. Please report to study hall in the library instead.” Willow nearly dropped her textbook right in the middle of the hallway. She was understandably beginning to panic. This was getting too weird to be a simple coincidence. It was clear that there was some correlation between her dreams and the chain of events that were occurring before her very eyes. She knew one thing: Today was going to be a sick day. She walked to the office, shaking. The nurse turned to face her. “What’s wrong, Willow?” She said, concerned. She was one of those people in the school that knew everyone’s name. “I…think I have the flu.” She choked on these words. The nurse put her hand on her forehead to check the temperature. “You don’t feel warm…” She said, skeptical “but I can see you need to go home” Before she knew it, the night rolled around. This time the dream was about that guy from her church; seventy-something William, the next night, her neighbor, fourteen-year old Joel. Then, out of nowhere, something terrifying happened on the third night. The third night, the dream seemed to more of that “lucid” type dream that everyone seems to be talking about. Willow saw herself in this dream, but the weird thing was that this time it didn’t seem like one. She wasn’t unable to move or feel like usual, but it almost seemed she could see what was happening to her even though she felt she was in her own body. This time, it seems like the images were actually not as vivid, although they felt more real. She felt unbearable waves of pain in her breathing during this time, right before she heard those same words. “I love you”. She begged her mom to let her stay home from school, complaining about “stress” and a headache. Her mother would have none of it, and refused to let her stay. Walking to the train station that morning, the inevitable happened. As she was passing a darkened alleyway, a man that she didn’t have time to get a description of jumped out, put a rag over her mouth with one hand and grabbed her neck with a vice-like grip in the other. She uttered muffled shrieks while she flailed; terrified about what she knew was going to happen. Her will to kick and scream slowly deteriorated. Her head began to swim, and eventually she slipped off into unconsciousness. She had accepted her fate. She woke up on a cold metal floor. The back of her head was pounding and hurt like she had simply been dropped while she was unconscious. The room was almost completely pitch black, except for a handful of dimly lit, dying candles that were scattered about. Her vision was doubled and blurred for the most part, as she was still dealing with the after affects of whatever was on that rag, maybe chloroform. After what seemed like a few minutes, she gained the strength to sit up and take in her surroundings a bit more. What sat before her eyes came as a shock. The dead bodies of the people who had been disappearing over the past few days were sitting, decaying against one the walls. The corpses had been mangled and destroyed in ways shockingly similar to what she had been seeing. Her eyes automatically started to search for Jonathan. What she had feared became an undeniable reality. The little boy seemed to have been tortured to an unfathomable extent. She turned away, eyes brimming with tears. Now it was time for the terror to set it. Willow came to the abrupt realization that she had no idea where she was, and she was sitting in a room full of dead bodies. Her breath began to quicken as she cried harder then she was before. She broke out in a cold sweat, her vision began to blur. Even though deep down she knew that this wasn’t going to help, the young girl called out: “Where am I? Please, someone help me, please!” Much to her surprise, she was answered. “My, my. Sleeping beauty is awake!” The voice was raspy and thick, and sounded as though the man had just gotten finished swallowing shards of glass. Willow watched in horror as a horribly disfigured man walked out of the shadows. He appeared to be a burn victim, his face was raw and red in some places, while glossy and freakishly white in others. One eye was nearly forced close due to scar tissue. He wore a ripped, stained t-shirt and pants that were so destroyed they barely seemed to stay on. He was emaciated, and his ribs were clearly visible through the shirt. “Who are you?” She shrieked, “Where am I? Please, let me go!” “My dear Willow” he came over to her, and graced the bottom of her chin with his ice-cold, bony fingers. “Now I can’t let you go so soon. I haven’t even gotten to fix you yet.” The disturbing thing about his words was the warmth in them, despite the dark, morbid meaning. He spoke like a loving father, comforting his child. “You must have seen this coming, I have been warning you for more than a year now.” “Warning? How?” He chuckled. “You really did think those were dreams, didn’t you?” “WHAT?” “See here young Willow, it’s not too hard to drug someone. I would simply give you enough of the drug to paralyze and confuse you, take you with me, and put you back. I did this with a few other people too; I think you may recognize a few of them. But then there were the times I got a bit… carried away.” He chuckled again and motioned towards the bodies. “But some of those people, they were murdered! And then they were fine, I saw them again later!\" “Well I didn’t take you here every night dear. I wouldn’t doubt that you did actually dream about it sometimes. The mind is a funny thing.” “But… but…” Her head was swimming. She did notice that these “dreams” were pretty different sometimes, maybe less vivid. “I saw myself in that dream… or… something yesterday. And there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with me.” He grinned in the most disturbing fashion Willow has ever seen. “You haven’t taken off your tank top in awhile, have you?” He said. He was actually right. Willow had worn the tank top to bed the last night and was so distraught that she simply left it on while she was getting dressed. Confused, she lifted it to her ribcage, and gasped. There was a large, hastily stitched wound sitting right under her ribs. “What did you do ?!” She screamed “I knew it was time to fix you this morning… but I couldn’t help myself. I got a head start.” He said this with almost a growl and a disturbing amount of pleasure. Willow didn’t feel the need to press for details at that point in time. It wouldn’t do her any good. “But I love you, Willow.” He said, “I wanted you to be aware of what was going on for once. Too bad this is all about your father.” “My father?” “See here, when we were in our twenties, we worked together at a factory. You were a newborn then, and you were the most beautiful girl. It was a very modest job, but he did what he could to provide for you. We weren’t the best of friends, but we were friends. No problems.” He paused, turned away and grimaced. “Then one day, oh that one day, there was a massive fire in that factory. Some idiot let a machine overheat, and with all the chemicals and spills everyone was far too lazy to clean, the fire spread quickly. Your father and I were next to each other near the back of the factory, and in those days nobody gave a second thought to put in a couple of emergency exits. He started to run, and so did I, but I tripped and sprained my ankle. He looked back at me, and I remember looking up at him, so pathetically and helplessly. And you want to know what he did? He just kept going. I managed to somehow hobble out…” He went up to the nearest wall and kicked it. “But now I look like this . Do you have any idea what it’s like to have dozens of cosmetic surgeons tell you there’s no hope; to go out in the public and see children crying at the sight of you? Their parents try not to look shocked, to look through me instead of stare, but I know what they think. I know what they all think. So I came here, to hide myself in this abandoned storage building. After awhile, I finally had what I needed to kill him. But I wasn’t satisfied. All of those people you have been seeing, they knew your father in some way. They had his blood. Remember Jonathan? His mother was a close “friend” of your dad, and Jonathan was his son.” Willow’s mouth fell open. She was never too close with her dad, but how could she not have known? Willow had barely known her dad. He was a very hard-working man, and was always at work. He was tearing up now. “But I had to save you Willow. I had to wait until you were seventeen; you can handle it now. I love you. I always have. I’m trying to help you. Those people out there are demons. Aren’t you happy, Willow? I got rid of them, or at least I warned them. They can’t hurt you. But there are still so many out there. That’s why I decided to bring you here. You’re going to be in a better place.” He smiled now, another disturbing mood swing. “But first, we have to fix you.” Willow closed her eyes as the man laid her on the wooden plank and strap down her limbs in a fashion similar to the old medieval torture method known as “the rack”. “I’m sorry we have to spend our last moments like this, Willow. But it must be done. The only reason is that you have impurities caused by him. You have too much of your father in you. I know you’re scared, but I know what’s best.” He reached into the pocket of his hardly-intact jeans and pulled out a sharp, surprisingly clean scalpel. “Now keep in mind, he’s leaving you. You’re going to be better soon.” Without saying another word, he stuck the scalpel into the young girl’s arm. She cried into the empty air in agonizing pain, tears streaming down her face. He put a hand gently over her mouth. “Let him leave you.” He repeated the process with the other arm. He ran his fingers through her hair; to sooth her in some twisted way. “I had to do that, you have his blood running though you. But you don’t have to feel it any more, Willow. The pain is over” He said through tears. He took a needle from his pocket and plunged in into her abdomen. Within seconds, she was numb from the neck down. She tried not to watch as he used the scalpel to open her midsection, removing so called “impurities”. Willow had realized awhile ago that it was all over and it was no use fighting. She was already weak from the blood loss and could hardly keep her head up. All of the “dreams”, they were warnings. This was her fate. “You’re pure now. He’s gone, he’s gone…” The man was rambling on to himself, and even though she was light headed and dizzy, she could make out him saying “angel” and “I love you” over and over. He turned back to the dying girl. “You’re so beautiful now, Willow. He’s gone now.” He took her hand in his, the other holding the blade, and drew it across her neck. She looked up at him and said this is a pathetic, weak voice. “Why…” but before she could finish whatever she was going to say, her eyes drifted shut. The man resigned, laying her hand gently next to her. He walked off, and retrieved an old shotgun, loaded with only one bullet. “I can be with you now, Willow, forever…”"}

Arguing with the man was out of the question", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Monsters", "Nature", "We Go Bump", "Places"], "content": "It was a chilly November evening. The wind was quiet but ever present. I was making my way home on the railroad tracks. Cursing and mentally hitting myself for not leaving sooner, I started the trek home, the sun dipping below the horizon. My dad was going to kill me when I got back. He always wanted me home before dark. I’m not sure exactly why though. The tracks had become familiar to me over the year of walking them; it wasn’t like I would get lost. Maybe he was afraid I would get attacked by something or that I might find a white van strangely alluring. Arguing with the man was out of the question, so I did my best to stay on his good side. Only one other time had I walked the four miles home in the dark. A similar situation that I was in now, crashing at a friend’s house and waking far too late. I couldn’t drive at this time, I was a bit too young and my dad wouldn’t pick me up (I assume to build responsibility skills or something of the like). However, I did pick up some tricks to ease my paranoia that night, music up and eyes down. I may like the thought of night, but when stuck in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night, I become a paranoid, shaking mess. Also, having a colorful imagination is a praised gift, and a wretched curse. If you look around you, your imagination is allowed to dance around your surroundings, making dead trees and bushes vivid hallucinations. This is why my eyes were down. If you take in the noises, the smallest crunch of leaves or a snapping branch becomes a terrible beast that wishes only your suffering. To combat this, my music blared. The only way I got home that night was watching the dim moonlight bouncing off the rails beside me and drowning out any misconceptions about my surroundings. Not feeling like being scolded for getting home late, I tried to race the sun as I got onto the tracks. The sun was defiant though, and fell only twenty minutes later, plunging me into darkness. A gut feeling of impending doom in the form of my dad set firmly in my stomach. Realizing this, I slowed my pace and began to tread steadily home. My previous experience kicked in. Not wanting to feel the effect of the shadows around me, I put my music in and locked my eyes to the rocky path between me. It’s really a strange feeling to walk at night with not a single light for hundreds of yards. Sure, the tracks were built along a road, but the road was a good couple hundred feet away. Homes dotted along the way on one side and cornfields on either side, separating me from the homes on my right. Being November, the fields had long been harvested, leaving only rugged, torn landscape. A minor treeline on either side poorly concealed the railroad and completed the pathway. Time passed and my way only grew darker. What were once dead trees, empty cornfields, and distant houses became silhouetted with blackness, and the rails gave off a familiar glow from the moonlight. I could faintly see the treeline in which my home lay. I had a long way to go. Thoughts filled my head, not of terror or the fear of being jumped by someone, but of regular problems. Well, I can’t say regular, as everyone has something to preoccupy them. I had an excess amount time when I walked. Doing this gave me about an hour and a half each way to myself, the dull hum of music in my ears. The lyrics and beats didn't really stick with me, but the white noise really does aid in my self-pity. I can only think of the wrong things. I’m not sure why, but every time I do get a chance like this, I only talk down to myself, crushing my dreams and aspirations. My greatest enemy is myself. It’s a mindset that I can’t seem to rid myself of. Maybe this is why I lose confidence in situations like this. The darkness. These thoughts brought me back to reality as I realized I was still in the shadows. Clouds had begun to slowly set in above me, making the path fade even further. The hue given from the rails dimming, making my path even more difficult to traverse, regardless of being a straight shot. A feeling crept up on me. It was subtle at first, but was becoming ever present with each hallowed step I took. The treeline began to thicken, as I was nearly a mile from my home. I no longer felt as if I was safe. My strategy of avoiding my imagination waned and it began to take hold. Silhouetted tree limbs blurred with the rest of the surroundings. They looked as if they had fingers, waving slowly in the chilly night breeze; however, they lacked any and all color. The rocks seemed flatter to me, losing the distinguished texture each had before. Once warmly-lit homes in the near distance extinguished as the trees on my right blocked them out, that long-lost paranoia surfacing once more. I remembered I had a knife in my left pocket and withdrew it quickly, as if something would assault me at any given moment. It's a strange thing holding a weapon, whether it be a knife, a rock, or even a stick—the feeling it gives someone, that is. It gives one the sense of comfort as well as the thought that one could take on anything the world slung at them. It did little for me, however. I gripped it tightly in my right hand, holding it at a ready stance while continuing my trek. I was well aware of what kind of things came out at night, having run into a few myself in the wee hours of summer evenings, and the daunting sight of seeing road—or rather rail—kill. It could be as harmless as a deer or a lizard or as aggressive as a coyote or a defensive skunk. Possums usually didn’t care too much. They simply kept walking or tried their best to avoid any altercations. However, being me, and as terrified as I was, I wasn’t about to take any chances. One day you’ll run into something that isn’t afraid of the sound of your footsteps or smell, but rather defensive about it. Almost. I was almost home. Another half mile and I was in the clear. I only had to go through an area with trees on my right and a cornfield on my left. Easy, I thought to myself, but something didn’t seem right. A feeling settling deep in my stomach that something was following me. I knew I had to keep walking. Well, that was my conscious mind anyway. My subconscious mind had other plans. I slowed my pace then stopped where I was. Something felt…off. I took my headphones out and tilted my head slightly to the left. I saw nothing in the field next to me. Looking forward, I saw nothing. Only the still faded glimmer of the two rails, stretching to the horizon. My right, same story. The short trees still looking like ominous, black fingers brushing against the air. I turned my body, but only ever so slightly, to throw a glance over my shoulder. Behind me looked just like in front of me. Dark and empty. I began a faint stride forward, my gaze returning slowly to look straight ahead. Just my mind, I thought to myself. Just about there. Only a small walk and I’d be—A noise erupted from my right within the treeline. The sound of crumpling leaves and snapping branches pervaded the air. I nearly fell flat on my face as I reacted. My knife swung blindly toward the direction of the sound. My headphones ripped from my ear and to my side in the flurry of flailing. Regaining my composure, I scanned the trees, knife in a set position. Eyes darting around, I couldn't see a thing. The pitch darkness still hindered my vision. I took out my phone with my free hand and touched the screen once. The screen lit up and I used it effectively as a flashlight. Searching the area, I couldn't find a single indication of where the sound came from. I was about to put it away when I saw a strange looking object. I crept down the side of the tracks to get a closer look. My foot freed a loose stone and it rolled toward the object. When the stone got near, the object hopped out of the way and bounced off into the underbrush. My heart skipped a beat when it moved, lowering itself from my throat to my stomach. Just a damn rabbit. It angered and relieved me. I stood back up and made my way back to the tracks. I stopped briefly to look at my phone. No minutes. Putting the useless flashlight away, I reached for my headphones. Groping around in the darkness, I couldn't find them. I had lost them when getting down to the underbrush. Cursing myself, I started walking again. Casting a glance around me, then behind me, I found nothing. Still the foreboding shadows. I sighed as I brought my glance back in front of me. My feet locked, halting me instantly. There was something in the distance. I felt heavy, weighted. All the breath in my lungs didn't want to leave, nor could I breathe it in. Out in front of me about a hundred feet was an object. More of a black form. I could see its head and part of a torso in the horizon. With the tracks going straight, nothing was hindering my vision of what was before me. It just stood there, unmoving. I didn’t know how to respond to this. I dropped my knife and stared at it. It didn’t make any advances on me. The deafening silence was consuming the area. I felt the sensation of being followed again, only much stronger. I turned to my left to looked out across the cornfield. I could see two, maybe three black dots. Behind me I could hear rocks being kicked, as if someone were walking on them. I turned and saw another figure behind me, a bit further than the first. I backed away from this one. Fear began to well up in me. These things were not normal. They only seemed to slide closer, not moving their legs. I turned back forward. The one in front of me had gone, so I ran in that direction. I didn't care about what it was I saw or that I had dropped some things back there; at that point I only wanted to get home. Running in the dark was difficult in the way that it’s hard to see what’s around you, but surprisingly easy to stay balanced. Adrenaline flowed in me. A flight response took ahold of me. Only a quarter mile to my house, wind rushing in my hair, and my eyes nervously observing the blurred area around me. I looked out to the field to see black figures and blobs moving about. To my right I could hear rustling leaves and something in the form of whispers. I dared not look behind me for fear of what I might see and of losing my balance. Almost there. I could see the light of my home getting closer and brighter. My home was just off the tracks. I got to the pathway I had made in the brush and weeds to my right and jumped the nearly ten-foot slope down to it. It was only at this point I fumbled and fell down. My momentum carried me out of the brush and up to the edge of the street on which my home lay. It took me a moment to gather my bearings and stand once more. Wavering slightly as I stood, I hauled myself forward, not in a run, but a hindered walk. I stopped once my foot hit the beginning of the street. I felt that feeling again, only this time, it wasn't as threatening. I turned and looked up at the railroad tracks. Standing on the rail, about where the exit is, was the short shadowy figure. Sure, it unsettled me to see this strange manifestation, but somehow I knew it couldn't harm me. The streetlight was flooding at my feet. It seemed to hold me, comforting me. The figure and I stared at one another for a minute or two before it turned and simply went down the other side of the tracks, towards the corn field on the left side, opposite the way I came. Returning to my home, my dad was asleep, thank God, so I made my way to my room. Shutting the door and turning off my light, I jumped in bed, not bothering to even change my dirty, sweaty clothes. All I was absorbed in was that I was home once again and I was safe. The horrible ordeal was over. Naturally, my dad was coherent, even when sleeping, and knew that I came home late. It was about a week or so before I could leave my house again. I took the same path back to town to see my friend. It was a little unnerving due to the recent events, but one has to move on at some point. I was about a mile out from my home when I hit the treeline that opened up to the road, now on the left, and the fields on either side. The lack of music annoyed me, but I'll take the loss of headphones over the loss of my life, I thought in my crazed head. Instead of listening to a dull white noise and tearing myself down more, I actually took in my surroundings. For the year or so that I have been making this trek, never once did I find this path more beautiful. I could finally appreciate the effects of fall on the environment. It was awe-inspiring. With fresh air in my lungs and the astounding sights around me, I felt like I could carry myself better. It felt good after so long of a down streak. I was just about out of the heavy treeline when something caught me eye. In the morning sun, a small glint of something was sticking out of a nearby oak tree. Curious, I went over to it to investigate. When I got closer, I could see what it was. It didn't make me feel good. Stuck in the tree was my knife, my lost headphones draped over them. When I got up to it, I found out that the headphones were utterly busted, which didn't surprise me too much. I took them and shoved them in my pocket. Grabbing a firm hold of the handle, I yanked it free of the tree. Out of reaction, I felt the blade portion of the weapon, and felt something rather odd about it. I turned the knife to the sun so I could see what was on it. It was scratched, not in a damaged way, as in something was written on it, possibly by a rock. I took a deep breath as I read aloud to myself. “You’re never alone.\" Written by FantasyPhantom Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

I jump", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Monsters"], "content": "Languidly, I begin to open my eyes as I lay on the damp, stone ground. Where am I? I lift my head slowly up, and a spine tingling shiver courses through my body. In front of me was a very large, and very dark castle. To my side was an old, rusty lantern. Its glass was cracked, but it appeared to still be usable. As I reach out for my only source of light in this dark place, I notice my strange clothing. I was wearing a long, light blue and lavender, Gothic Victorian styled dress. It was tattered around the waist, and was missing sleeves, but seemed to fit well. Suddenly, my head begins to pound. Thunder sounds from all directions, and lightning lights up the night sky. I swiftly grab the lantern and make my way up the mossy stone steps to the entrance of the castle. I rest the side of my head up against the giant sealed doors to listen for any sign of life inside, but it was quiet. Almost too quiet. Where was I meant to go now? I take a step back from the large door, contemplating my next move. Out of the corner of my eye, I could have sworn I just saw one of the old, dusty curtains close abruptly as I take notice of my surroundings. Was someone inside, watching me? That seems to be the only explanation. But then again, it could have been my corrupt mind playing tricks on me. I hurriedly run back down the steps to try and find another way into the building. To my left, I notice a winding dirt path that seemingly leads to the opposite side of the immeasurable manor. Quietly, I follow the pathway, slowly looking from side to side to determine if any eyes are fixed upon me. No one else seems to be around at the moment but me, but I can't shake the feeling that someone is there, glaring at me from some unknown place. At the end of the trail lay a few sturdy looking wooden crates, all scattered around as if someone didn't even care about what may happen to them. I look up to the sky in search for anything that may help me, but all I can see are the foreboding looking clouds as the lightning lights up the night sky like a flaming torch. That's when I notice it. Alongside the dark stone wall, just out of reach, was an assortment of thick vines. If I could find a way to grab onto them, I'd be able to climb my way up the wall, and finally get inside this building. But why do I want to even get inside? Any sane person would immediately turn away at the sight of the mansion, but I chose to find a way in... Perhaps I'm not sane. I'm not sure why, but there is just something about this place... It feels like I need to be here. To be within the walls, to find a purpose of why I ended up here. As the first few drops of rain from the oncoming storm start to fall, I begin stacking the wooden crates up in a fashion similar to stairs. Once that task is completed, I carefully ascend the man-made steps, holding my lantern by my teeth as I get prepared to jump for the tangle of vines. I jump, and at the last second, I grab onto the thick foliage. I can feel my fingers slipping from the wet greenery, but I manage to hoist myself up and through an open window. I collapse onto the floor, breathing heavily. My headache slowly returns, and my vision becomes a blur. Am I going insane? After the horrible sensation eventually passes, I gradually get to my feet and look around the room. There was really nothing much to it, but it did seem darker than it should. I look down at my lantern, and the flame was very low. Great, I was running out of oil. I step out into the dim hallway and notice a flight of stairs leading down to my right. Hesitantly, I lift up my lantern and descend down the dark stairwell. Dusty portraits of sinister looking men line the walls crookedly, and I shudder at the sight of them. One painting in particular caught my eye, though. It was a portrait of an older man, his white, long hair tied in a ponytail with a dark bow. He was wearing a red suit, and his face... His face gave an uneasy feeling. The longer I stared at the picture, the more uneasy I felt. His face appeared to gradually change, and time seemed to slow down immensely. Not knowing if my eyes were playing tricks on me or not, I began to see distinct changes in his face. His eyes grew red, and his skin slowly became pale. Soon after that, his eyes were solid black, full of horror. Red liquid streaked down his cheeks in a way that can only be mimicked by the crying of a young girl as her mascara slowly drips from her eyes. I had to turn away. The sight was far too gruesome to bear for long. I continue my way down the stairs, diverting my eyes from any painting that I pass. At the end of the long staircase stands a bloody iron door. Blood was still dripping from the handle... Grimacing, I take hold of the handle and pull open the heavy door. In front of me was a long, dark hallway, only lit by a few torches that were very sparsely placed along the walls. The hall was also eerily cold, and I could see my shattered breaths before me, floating in the air and slowly dissipating like a ghost. I make my way down the corridor, but I had that feeling of being watched once more. I turn around, but no one is there, just like before. Shaking off the feeling, I walk somewhat faster down the hallway. As I reach the end, an old bloody note hangs on the wall, and I become weak in the knees as I read what it states. \"Don't let her escape...\" A small whimper emits from my throat and I begin to shiver. What now? I could hide, but I know nothing about this old building. I could try to escape, but I'd have nowhere to go even if I somehow succeeded. As I stand there, I hear a loud growl from somewhere behind me. I turn around once again and my limbs go numb. I couldn't move, I couldn't do anything. All I could do was stand motionless and in horror, staring wide eyed at the horrid creature before me. Stumbling down the hall was what appeared to be a man, but it did not exactly seem human. His eyes were missing, and his mouth was permanently open in such a way that you would think he was screaming. He had no hair, and was very pale. Rusty iron shackles hung from his wrists, and the reverberation of the chains gave me chills. A circular contraption was fixated tightly around his neck, and dried blood stained the pointed metal that pierced his skin. He continued getting closer, and closer, until he was merely a few feet in front of me. He reaches out, and my limp fingers drop my lantern. It crashes to the floor, the glass breaking into a million pieces. All the lights in the hall burn out, and I'm left with no sense of sight whatsoever. I scream out in tears as I feel a sharp pain make its way through my abdomen, and a warm fluid that I can only imagine was my blood drips from the wound and down my waist. I fall to the floor and curl up into a ball, near death. The last thing I see is an old man carrying a torch enter the hall, an evil grin across his face. Shadows from the flame of his torch dance across his long white hair as he pulls surgical tools from a bag hanging by his side. After pulling out some bloody thread and a pair of rusted scissors, he flashes one last evil smile before kneeling down beside me, ultimately ending my life for good."}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Night_of_Hell", "title": "Untitled", "author": "the way they were bringing the old Packard", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Demon/Devil", "Hospitals"], "content": "My name is Kurt, and in the year 1939 I was nineteen years old and the head Security Guard at the Sedgwick County Hospital in Wichita Kansas. 1939 might seem like a long time ago to some of you youngsters out there but believe me it's not, and I remember it like it was yesterday. The old county Tuberculosis Ward had just closed down and we were in the middle of transporting patients to the temporary ward we had set up in our Hospital. It was late fall about two weeks before Thanksgiving and the weather had started turning foul. On that day it was suppose to storm, and ooh boy, storm it did. I was working the late shift 6pm to 6am in the Emergency Ward the night she came in. I knew right away something was amiss by the way they were bringing the old Packard (for you younger folk out there that was a car company that made Ambulances back then) into the bay; damn near at full speed. I stepped out into the bay to offer assistance bringing in the patient. The sky was dark with clouds and the first few drops of rain from the storm to come was dropping lightly from the sky. The Medic jumped out of the back of the wagon, his face was pale and drawn glancing over at me he motioned for my assistance so I joined him at the back of the wagon. “What we got tonight Rick?” I asked arriving at the rear of the wagon. Rick was older than me, maybe 25 or 26 but he didn't look any older. He was wearing his white on white Medic uniform with large red crosses on the shoulders with the initials EMS embroidered under them. I can still remember the look of concern on his face when he spoke to me, “Goddamn Kurt you're not gonna believe this one.” He pulled the gurney from the back of the wagon and I set eyes on her for the first time. She was a small lass maybe 5' 2”- 5'3” and a buck twenty at the most. Her red hair was dark and matted to her forehead, she appeared to be soaked from head to toe. Much to wet for the light drizzle that was coming from the sky. She was strapped to the gurney with the wide leather straps that were usually reserved for larger patients that were having fits. I turned to Rick about to ask just what the hell was going on when she suddenly lunged forward, breaking the strap on her left arm as if it was a shoe string. She swung her free hand at my face open palmed using her nails as if they were the claws of some wild cat. I pulled back within mere moments of loosing an eye. “Jesus Christ!!” I shouted as I instinctively stepped back away from the flailing claw. “Jesus can't help you now, you're mine you son-of-a-bitch all mine,” the woman growled at me. Her voice sounded hoarse and gravely as if she has been screaming for days and there were only a few good working cords left. Jack who had been driving the wagon stepped from behind me and grabbed her loose arm trying to force it back to the side of the gurney. Jack was a young man about my age and built a lot like me too, standing about 6' tall and around 220lbs. What I saw next is hard for me to believe to this day, even though I saw it with my own eyes. That little woman picked Jack up in all his mass with her one arm and slung him to the ground as if he was nothing more than a sack of potatoes. I was stunned. Over come with fear and confusion, the rain hammering down now in a torrent as Rick was shouting for me to grab her fucking arm before she did more damage. But I could barely hear him over the beating of my heart. I shook off the initial shock and grabbed a hold of her free arm as she tried another swipe at my face. Using all of my 235lbs I tried to force her arm down to the side of the gurney so Rick could fasten another leather strap; but if felt more like I was holding on to the arm of Wild Red Berry's then the arm of the diminutive patient that was lying on the gurney in front of me. After what seemed like an hour of struggling trying to gain control, Jack re-appeared with several nurses and Doctor Hemmerman. Apparently he had gotten wise and had ran inside the hospital for more help after being tossed to the ground. Nurse Brown helped me hold the patients free arm while Doctor H. tried injecting Phenobarbital into the arm still restrained by the leather strap. Despite the combined weight of Nurse Brown and myself the patient was still bucking and wildly thrashing back and forth lifting me off my feet in several instances. The bucking made the injection difficult and when Doctor H. pulled the needle from the patients arm blood ran freely down her shoulder. “That should calm her down, but it may take a few minutes before it kicks in lets get that arm strapped back down,” Doctor H. shouted over the incoherent shouts and obscenity that had continually streamed from the patient. With Jack, Nurse Brown, Doctor H and myself we managed to hold her free arm long enough for Rick to fasten another thick leather restraint around her wrist and to the bottom rail of the gurney. We managed to move the patient into the hospital proper. Getting her into room one, being the closest to the ambulance bay doors, and all the while she bucked and spat and screamed. Sometimes just pure obscenity, sometimes in what sounded like a foreign language. But it never ceased. Several times she had thrust her tongue out until it seemed it would tear from her mouth and fall to the floor. Meanwhile the storm had reached a tempest, lightning brought the windows to brilliant white flashes while thunder rocked the walls of the building. “You will all roast in the fires of Hell, and be the damned whores of Satan,” echoed though the halls of the hospital as the patient continued her barrage of obscenities, blasphemies and insane laughter. I was right in the room with her, trying my best to keep calm. Though to be honest I had never been so scared in all my life. I had been in the rooms of the mentally ill, the suicidal, hell even the homicidal in the coarse of my job. But nothing had ever bothered me half as much as that little woman strapped to a gurney with restraints designed for men three times her size. I couldn't explain it then, and I can't much explain it now other than somewhere deep inside, I knew, I was in danger and not just in the physical sense. Through a small gap between the privacy curtain and the wall of the patients door I could see Doctor H. talking to Jack. I knew Jack had to be giving Doctor H. his notes on the patient call so I moved as close as I could to hear the conversation while remaining close enough to re-act in case she decided to get frisky again. I could just barely make out what Jack was saying over the patient describing to me how I was to be sodomized by demons upon my demise. “The call originally was of someone drowning in the Arkansas River,” Rick was saying, his voice trembled slightly as he retold the story. “When we arrived she was standing in the River up to her waist in what had to be freezing ass water and that's when we noticed the child.” “Child! What child??” interrupted Doctor H. “There was a child with her Sir, about 5 maybe 6 years old. She was dunking the child's head into the river over and over again. We asked her what the hell she was doing and she yelled that she was baptizing her daughter in the name of Satan.” “My God! Where is the child now?” “Down at the Orphanage Sir, she was unharmed other than being cold to the bone,” Rick finished his story with a shudder that shook his entire body. Rick and Jack left the hospital, Doctor H. and I stayed with the patient. The Doc looked troubled, it had been over 30 minutes since the Phenobarbital had been administered and the patient was still thrashing, shouting blasphemies and obscenities. Add to that the fierce storm raging outside and the flickering of the hospital lights that eerily seemed to sync with the pitch of the patients screaming and let me tell you the shorts I was wearing that day were not fit to ever be used again. Finally the Doc seemed to come to a conclusion, he requested a nurse to bring him Phenothiazene and the patients chart. Again Nurse Brown and myself held the patient by the shoulders using all our weight to try to steady the patient as Doctor H. gave the shot. He then grabbed up the patients chart wrote something hastily and stood staring at what he had wrote as if he was second guessing himself. Finally he resigned, let out a heavy sigh and tossed the chart on the counter where it landed open. Doctor H. turned to me and said, “She needs to be moved. Out back to the Treatment Center, we can't have her disturbing the other patients.” His normally well tanned face was nearly paper white. I must have had a shocked look on my face as well because he placed his hand on my shoulder and said, “I know, but under the circumstances...” he looked at the patient again who was still thrashing about, “Just do it o.k.?” The treatment center the Doc had referred to was an old brick style one story building that sat in the back of the Hospital. It was originally used when the Hospital had been the Kansas Sanitarium back in 1926 for less than conventional forms of medicine like electroshock therapy and Light Baths. It was just an empty building now, the last time it was used was to store rabbit food when that swindler Rajah convinced a bunch of people that Rabbit fur coats was going to be the next big thing and had turned the Sanitarium into a damn Rabbit farm. The Doc left the room informing me that he would send Brown back in as well as a couple of other duty Nurses to help transport the patient back to the Treatment Center. After he left I went straight for the patients chart, I just had to know what the Doc had written that bothered him so badly. Oh how I wish I hadn't looked, though I guess now it wouldn't have change things if I hadn't. I glanced through the chart that was mostly blank, as no identification or vitals had been obtained, till I saw the diagnosis line, written there was three words that sent a bolt of ice cold fear right down my spine, it simply said, “possible demonic possession”. Now we had all been thinking it, and murmurings had floated around the Nurses Core since we had brought the patient into the hospital. But to see it written, by a respectable Doctor, it just made it seem too real. And not for the last time that evening I felt like I was going to run. Brown and several other duty Nurses came into the room and I quickly sat the chart down. Brown had informed me that they had moved the other patients out of the east hall of the E.R. so we could move the patient without exposing anyone else to harm. The plan worked well as we moved quickly though the hall, out the back side of the hospital and out into the storm. Lightning flickered through the sky, lighting the rear of the hospital to almost day light illumination while thunder blasted our ears thankfully deafening us to the sounds of the manic laughter and horrible blasphemies pouring still from the young woman’s mouth. The Center was dimly lit and still smelled of rotting rabbit food and dung, even though those items hadn't been in the area for almost a decade. We wheeled the patient into one of the specialty treatment rooms that thankfully had a thick wooden door that could close. Brown turned to me, “Doctor Hemmerman wants you to stay here with the patient. He has arranged for an, uh counselor of sorts to come see her, you'll know him when he gets here. You are to let him in and close the door and do not leave until he is finished understand?” I nodded noticing the sudden panic rising from my stomach threatening once again to make me bolt out of that building and straight for home. It was an hour before anyone arrived at the Treatment Center, during which time the patient never ceased yelling obscenities and speaking in that strange language that made me feel sick inside when I heard it. When he arrived I recognized him instantly as a Catholic Priest, I couldn't believe it, I had known Doctor Hemmerman well before I had worked for the hospital and he never struck me as a religious man. I was shocked enough at his diagnosis, but to send a Priest? I nodded towards the Priest as he walked to me and simply said, “Father.” I've never been a religious man myself so I wasn't sure if there was anything else I should say or not so I stood there feeling uncomfortable about the whole situation. The priest spoke to me, “Son, what is to happen here tonight must never be spoken of. Doctor Hemmerman has told me that I could trust that of you, is that so?” “Yes Father, but what..” that was as far as I got before he walked past me into the room and firmly shut the door. At first everything was quiet for the first time that night, all I could hear was the tapping of the rain against the metal roof of the center. The thunder seemed to have calmed and if the patient was still making noise it did not penetrate through the thick wooden door. Then I heard it, barely audible at first but it was definitely there, it was the sound of chanting. I guessed it to be Latin, based only on the knowledge that the Catholics often did their prayers in Latin. Soon after the chanting I began to hear the patient again, her high pitched voice echoed inside the room before spilling out into the hall through the door giving it an even more demonic tone than before. What she was saying I could not tell you, for again it was in that strange language. It wasn't the same language the priest was chanting what ever it was. The priest's voice rose, chanting louder and more intense, the patients voice rose to match switching from the unknown language back to English and the things she was saying, the blasphemies, to this day I cannot repeat. Not even in type, and they made me break into tears and I found myself apologizing to God for even hearing such things. The lightning and thunder had came back with a vengeance, the strikes coming with such intensity and consistency it was as if one continuous burst of electricity filled the air 'till I felt as if I was going to die from the anxiety of the situation. Suddenly a scream shattered through the center driving me to my knees. The scream was from nothing that ever walked this Earth and it shook me to the very core of my being, and then there was silence. I sat on my knees on the floor crying for a good three minutes before I could regain enough composure to stand. The storm had seemed to have ended, there was no thunder or sound of rain on the roof. There was no chanting, no sound from the patient. So I stood staring at the wooden door wondering if I should open it and check or just leave it alone. After about 5 minutes the door finally opened, the Priest stood in the doorway, his gray face looked like it had been molded from wax, blood dripped down the side, I think coming from his ear. Behind him lay the patient, a sight I will remember 'till my death. Her skin had gone a pale green color, her jaw looked like it had been nearly torn from her face leaving her mouth agape in a strange way that made me think that something large had crawled its way out of her corpse. Her tongue lolled outside of her mouth laying on her cheek and her eyes had rolled into her head leaving nothing showing but the whites. There wasn't any doubt that she was dead. I quit the hospital that night, after swearing to Doctor H. and the priest again that I would never speak of the incident. A promise I guess I have broken, not that it matters, all the people who were there are either my age or dead by now. Nothing ever came up in any of the papers, not that I expected anything like that to ever be reported. The hospital closed and was torn down in 53 and there's nothing left now but a broken side walk and a barren field. But that night did happen and let me tell you, it changed my life."}

Particularly I liked to do these activities with my cousin Jake", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Beings", "Nature"], "content": "I’ve always been a country boy. I live in the sticks of Kentucky. Near a pretty thick forest, that was around two miles from my house. I always liked to spend all day outside, and sometimes camp outside just for fun. I loved nature and the outdoors. I went hunting and fishing in the fall and could spend hours hiking in the woods. Name’s Chris by the way. Particularly I liked to do these activities with my cousin Jake, who lived just five minutes away. And it was on THAT night...that night, I think in my seventh grade year, that me and my cousin may have been driven away from anything of the sort for a very long time. It was not the first time something like this happened. Actually just a week prior to this, my family took a trip to Pennsylvania, where me and Jake saw, I swear to god in heaven a, god damn Not Deer. My dad just said Not Deer are a myth, and that sometimes deer just stand on their hind legs. And I did believe him. I mean, nothing like that could actually exist right? Anyway, it was this night that has really stuck with me though. And no, it's not because my cousin was heart wrenchingly killed or some creepypasta shit like that. No, it was mostly just like a normal camp trip. Well, one of my trips which was just for fun. And that, well...well you’ll see. We didn't go too far from the house, but at the same time, we were far enough to where we could only see the lights from the house. We took a fairly large bright green tent, an electronic lantern and a couple of sleeping bags and that was really it. We weren't going all out, making a fire and everything, we were just gonna you know, sleep under the stars. That was the plan. We got a decent amount of distance away and decided to set up shop. We hitched our tents fairly quickly at around midnight and settled in. We chatted about pretty straightforward things. The same kind of stuff you’d talk about when camping. Hunting, nature, and our favorite thing, urban legends. Jake told me this one story about how his family went camping in a camper and in the middle of the night there was a bunch of scratching at the door. He said it was a skinwalker, but right after said he made it up. Skinwalkers. The concept of them always kinda creeped me out. But at the same time, not a lot really scares me. One time when we were in 6th grade me and Jake did a Bloody Mary ritual on a swing set. The worst thing that happened was when Jake fell off the swing and almost broke his pelvis. And we did other shit like playing a game called Don’t get struck by lighting. Where during a thunderstorm we would run outside waving shovels in the air and well, try not to get struck by lightning. Anyway after chatting for a bit we finally went to sleep. I slept pretty well until Jake woke me up half awake. “Hey dude get up,” he said. I rubbed my eyes as I hesitatingly sat up. “Ah, what is it?” I asked him. “Don’t ya hear that?” he asked. I did hear something. Faintly. It sounded like something whistling. Not like a bird, singing a happy tune in the orange sky, but real whistling. HUMAN whistling. I went out of the tent with the lantern, my hand shaking slightly, to see where it was coming from. I looked forward. My house's lights were getting nowhere near where we were. I looked to the left. Nothing but grass and trees in the distance. I looked to the right. It got slightly louder. I shined the light in that direction. I saw nothing but trees and grass. I thought I could slightly see the outline of some sort of animal near the trees. The woods were at least two hundred meters away so I couldn't tell what it was. All I saw was that it was on four legs. For some reason I decided to whistle back. I whistled a simple, very short tune and just stood there...waiting for something to happen. And sure enough as soon as I started to go back in the tent, I heard the thing answer. And it wasn't random. It mimicked the sound perfectly. There was no fucking way it echoed. It was too far away to echo. “What the hell?” Jake said quietly. Slightly unnerved, I decided to go see what the thing was. Jake followed me too. With nothing but our lantern, we went to our backyard, since that was where I saw the figure. Eventually we made it to this fort we had in my yard. It was a small shed we built a year ago out of scrap metal. The walls are made of old street signs and sheet metal. And it was pretty damn durable, able to take multiple shots from a BB gun. I thought I heard something move around inside the shed, so I opened the door and headed inside. I looked around with the light for a little bit and said something bright on the ground. “W-what is that?” Jake asked, pointing at the strange thing on the ground. I picked it up and it had bright, white hair...just...like our cat. “What the hell is this?” I said. “Did that come...from Snowball?” Jake asked, with slight worry in his voice. I hadn't seen him worried like that in a long time. Next to the clumps of cat hair were these brown clumps of hair. We didn't have any more animals besides Snowball, our cat, so I have no idea what it was. Things were starting to get a bit too R.L. Stein for us, so we made our way back to our tents. When we made it back, we saw that the fence that surrounded the property was completely torn in half near where our tents were. That fence was wire metal, barbed on the top. There was no way some coyote or deer could’ve torn it so easily. We went back into our tent and tried to go back to sleep. We closed our eyes and began to drift off. Right before another anomaly occurred. Footsteps. HUMAN footsteps. All around our tent. We were petrified. I wanted to tell whoever was pranking us to cut it out, but something in me knew this wouldn't be a prank. Who would go this far? For a couple of 8th graders. They started out tame and slow. They slowly picked up in pace. Whatever was out there made no sound, aside from its thundering steps, splitting our souls in dread, as if any minute it would stop and come into the tent. Even with that, we somehow fell asleep, whether it be from exhaustion or passing out from fear (the latter being unlikely for us but it was terrifying nonetheless). I woke up from a dreamless slumber at around six in the morning, to the sound of REAL birds whistling. I immediately went out to see if that THING was gone. I wish I hadn't though. Right outside our tent were footprints surrounding the tent. DEEP footprints, behind, next to, and even right where I stepped out. They looked like a dog or wolf, but they were far too big to be that. Jake came out a few seconds later, and he could not hide his shock. I looked around to see the fence even more mangled, and a large, thick tree with three deep slashes in it. Jake and I quickly got to taking down our tent and grabbed our things and began a slow, tried walk home. I can’t begin to try to understand what the hell just happened to us that day. The only evidence being those footprints and the scratches. And...that on our way home...I noticed a coyote walking into a field in the distance, and that Snowball was lying on the front porch, whining, with a small bald spot and cut on her hind leg."}

Be as specific and detailed as possible.” Look, I’m going to make this as quick as possible for the obvious reasons. I will give my version of events for why I was fired and you’re going to do your damndest to try and get me my severance package or at least something to keep me going in-between jobs. How does that sound? Do we have a deal? It started about half a year ago when I had just moved to the area. I was looking to pick up some work as a veterinary technician, but there were no clinics hiring. I decided I would take any job that came my way to make ends meet until I could get my foot in the door at one of the veterinary clinics in the area. As you know, I managed to land a security job at this hospital. It was a pretty quiet job, I walked around on patrol every hour or so. Struck up a conversation with the nurses and patients when I was feeling chatty and spent the rest of my time reading “A Song of Fire and Ice”. What? It’s not like you can fire me twice. You would be surprised what I caught some of the other guards doing when I stepped in to relieve them. I’m just trying to give you a feel for my routine and lay all the cards out on the table. June 13 th began as a pretty quiet night. There were no belligerent drunks that needed to get their stomach pumped and I didn’t have to restrain any junkies who were fiending for another fix, but were stuck in detox. I liked these nights the best of all, where I don’t have to worry about a drunk vomiting on my shoes or have to talk a problem patient back into their beds. By the way, in the interview the boss man said nothing about how to restrain patients that weren’t free to leave. I’m just saying, with a little more training about protocol maybe we wouldn’t have had the situation we did and I wouldn’t be talking you through that night. Anyways, it was around eight o’clock that I got the call from the boss. He told me that the hospital was about to be getting a very important patient and asked me if I felt up to the task. I told him yes because there wasn’t another option. He could try to call someone else in to work for my 8 PM to 8 AM graveyard shift, but there wasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell he would find someone on such short notice. I agreed to watch the VIP even though I had no real clue of what I was doing. I decided to ask the charge nurse for some information about what hospital security typically does with important patients. I assumed that it was probably some B-list celebrity who had gotten tipsy at a club and rolled their ankle on the dance floor. The charge nurse told me what I already assumed. I would be sitting in their room making sure to keep any media or strangers out while doctors treated her. I asked her if she had any idea who was coming in and that was when she told me it was Christine Parker. I had no clue who that was. The charge nurse was apparently a big fan of “America’s Most Wanted” and watched it every week before it was canceled. She told me that in 2011, an eleven-year-old had gone missing on her way home for school. This girl, Christine Parker, had apparently been missing for over three years until today. She was picked up on the side of the roads from a nearby forest by highway patrol. She was set to arrive at the hospital in thirty minutes to treat the injuries she sustained in the escape from her captor. I did a quick walk around the hospital to make sure there weren’t any news crews setting up outside. Apparently, the police misled the media by telling them she was being sent to a larger metropolitan hospital while quietly sending Christine out to a hospital in the boondocks. Of course, this meant that they had to post up near the hospital they told the media about otherwise they would catch onto their duplicity. Their ploy had worked and there was no one in sight. The girl would be allowed to convalesce in peace without media buzzing around her like flies on a shit heap. Christine arrived and was taken up to the OR wing of the hospital. This wasn’t because she needed surgery, but because the OR was shut down on the weekends. I always assumed it was closed because the surgeons wanted some time to play a round of eighteen holes on the weekend without having to worry about checking in on their wards. She was brought into the OR because there weren’t a whole lot of people there and it would be easier to keep all non-essential personnel out of the way. There were a flurry of doctors around her and I couldn’t really get a good look at her through the whirlwind of white coats and nurses' scrubs. I caught glimpses. She had dirty brown hair that looked like it was a bird’s nest and hadn’t been combed in a long time. There were scars along her arms and legs that I am fairly certain didn’t stop at the sleeves of her clothes. Her right hand was shattered, it looked like it had been shoved into an industrial trash compactor. I tried to keep my stomach from turning as I looked at her hand, disjointed and deformed as if her own bones were straining against its fleshy confines and seeking to break free. She was emaciated and looked like she had been through hell. The doctors took a blood sample and left to run some tests and order a few scans. The nurses pulled the curtain and helped her change into some scrubs. When they pulled the curtain back, I saw that the scars indeed did not stop at her sleeves. The nurses asked some basic questions and then went on their way to treat their other patients. The only information I caught was that she was fourteen, she didn’t know if she had any allergies, and she had been held captive in the woods for over three years. Once the nurses left, it was just me and Christine in the hospital room. I had no clue of what to say to her. She was obviously shell-shocked. I am not really a conversationalist, so I tried to keep my trap shut and not look at her injuries. I didn’t do a good enough job because she caught me looking at her hand. She raised her broken right hand and said, “That hurt like a bitch.” She winced and raised her hand to her mouth as if she had said something horrible and I tried to put on my best smile and told her that it was alright if she wanted to swear. She'd been through a lot, it was alright. She paused and then said uncertainly, “Fuck, shit, balls.” She spoke like she was testing them out and enjoyed how they rolled off her tongue. She continued by telling me that he wouldn’t let her swear. It was here that I breached protocol and asked her what had happened out there in the woods. I wanted to have that information ready for the police when they arrived so maybe I could save her the trouble of re-hashing it for two stone-faced officers. I remember the time they asked a rape victim to describe her attacker’s genitals who then broke down at being forced to remember that trauma. I tried to give her that one mercy and protect her after she had been exposed to so much. She looked down and said, “The hand doesn’t hurt as much as you’d think. I think the fact that I had time to steel myself for what I had to do made it manageable. I needed to slip the cuffs. I had to do it otherwise he would take it from me again.” Do you understand? She did that to herself so she could escape! I then asked the question that I wish I never asked. I asked what her captor was going to take from her, thinking maybe he had given her a puppy or doll to assert control over her. Christine lowered her hand to her stomach and for a second, I thought she was having some intestinal issues until she said, “I’m late.” The horror of that statement barely had time to sink in before she continued. She said that she had missed her period once before and when her captor found out, he beat her viciously. She told me that he kept striking her until she was on the ground and then he kicked- Jesus! I can't even say it. She started to cry and there wasn’t a single thing I could think of to say to calm her down other than, “It’s over.” Around this time a nurse arrived and gave Christine a sedative. I think they did this so they could examine the extent of her injuries without causing her any more pain or the trauma of reliving it. I hate to say it, but I was thankful she was out cold. I didn’t want to hear any more about the horrors she had to endure for three years. The scars and improperly healed bone breaks were a testament to the tortures she had suffered. I watched over her for a few hours. I tried not to look too closely at the hundreds of scars, some calloused and healed while others looked like they were weeks old. The soles of her feet were blackened and cut up from running through the woods for miles while seeking help. I tried to not look at her mangled right hand that must have been agonizing even with whatever opioids and sedatives they had her on. I tried not to look. It was around five o’clock when the man showed up in the OR. I was getting ready to kick him out when he asked if I was watching over Christine Parker. He was an average looking guy. He was wearing jeans and had a weary look to him, like he hadn't gotten a decent night's sleep for days. I told him that I was watching over a private patient whose identity had not been known to me, just like the guide tells us to say. I thought he was some vulture from the newspaper who had slipped in, but that was when he told me that he was her father, Richard Parker. He kept pressing and eventually I relented under the condition that I stay in the room while he was there. I brought him into the room and he stood over the broken body of his girl. It looked like he could barely contain himself at the sight of her injuries, but he managed to keep himself under control. As she was unconscious, there wasn’t much he could do or say to her. He stroked the side of her face and then sat down next to me. We sat in silence for five minutes before he struck up a conversation with me. He told me all about his daughter, how she liked those frilly Disney princesses, how she used to be so afraid of the dark that he’d had to buy a nightlight, how he used to carry her around on his shoulders. She was so small then. It was here that he really cried. He buried his face in his hands and wept. He looked like a man who was weeping at a funeral, which in a sense, I guess he was. The daughter he had known had died. This was someone completely different now, shaped and warped by everything that monster did to her. He took a couple of minutes to get himself under control. He told me that his wife would be here shortly. We talked a little more. It was mainly small talk. I can’t even remember what we talked about exactly. He was more focused on Christine than talking, but I think he felt uncomfortable with the silence. I don’t have an exact time, but I think we probably dragged the conversation on for an hour or so. It was around 7:30 when Christine started to come to from the sedative. Richard Parker noticed her stirring and rushed to her side. He stroked the side of her face as she opened her eyes. He leaned down and planted a kiss on her forehead and whispered something into her ear. He turned towards me and told me that he promised he’d let his wife know when she was awake. He left for the main lobby just as my radio went off in my ear. It was my boss radioing in so he could take over my shift. I went down to the command post and greeted my boss. He typically showed up fifteen minutes early to let me off with a couple of extra minutes. He asked how it went, and I told him that it had been pretty quiet except for when the father visited. A look of confusion crossed his face, and he told me that Christopher and Regina Parker were supposed to be coming in at around noon so the doctors and nurses could bandage and treat her before the reunion. The realization hit me like a foot stomping onto a hand. I sprinted back towards the OR. I sprinted down the hallway, dodging nurses and doctors alike. Christine was bone white and the look in her eyes confirmed my worst fears. She sat frozen on the bed. She looked like she had seen the devil himself and to her eyes, she probably had. I was out-of-breath from running, but I managed to wheeze out, “Who was that?” She spoke in a whisper, but it felt like she was shouting the words right into my ears, “It was him. ” I croaked, “What did he tell you?” She looked up at me and in that moment her eyes were as wide as saucers. She said, “He told me that he ‘loved the time we spent together. And that we should do it ag-’” The rest of the words caught in her throat, and she broke down wailing and weeping. My boss arrived at around that time and I was fired almost on the spot. That’s my story. I know I messed up, but how could I have known who that guy was? Well now that I say it all out loud, I guess I really was in the wrong on this. I doubt I’m going to get a termination package. This trip out here was a waste of time, well not completely, maybe I’ll go give Christine a visit… Why are you looking at me like that? What’s going on here? This whole interview thing wasn’t about my severance or wrongful termination. This interview was about Christine! Oh God, is she all right? “Christine has been missing since last night. We have no clue where she could be.” Written by EmpyrealInvective Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

We had always wanted to make a fire outside and hang out at night, but we were too young to go by ourselves, especially after midnight. That year things were different. ‘We were no longer children,’ we thought, so we somehow convinced our parents to let us stay out late (we didn’t tell them about the fire, obviously). Once we all gathered in front of my house, we only had to think of a good place to hang out, so that our parents wouldn’t find out about the fire. We ended up making the fire near a small dirt road out by the forest, leading straight to the riverside. The set up was great: a creepy forest, the sound of the river flowing, crickets chirping, and the scary sight of an abandoned stone house in the background. It was a rather warm night for that time of the year, and the moon was shining over the forest, casting strangely shaped shadows on the walls of the abandoned house. It was quite unsettling when you caught a glimpse of a moving shadow out of the corner of your eye. By the time we had finished making the fire, the moon had moved slightly, and the shadows were gone, a thing which brought us a bit of relief. We found a slab of stone next to the river, and we used it as a makeshift stage in front of the fire for the storytellers to stand on while narrating their creepy tales. We took our flashlights out of our backpacks and started. A few stories in, it was finally my turn, so I grabbed my flashlight and headed towards the stage. I had just started my scary story when, all of a sudden, it was freezing cold. The flashlight turned itself off, and the wind started blowing violently, putting out the fire. I panicked, and I kept slapping my flashlight in the hope of it turning back on. Assuming it was a joke of mine, but still unsettled by the whistling of the wind, everybody instinctively reached for their flashlights, but none of them worked. Overwhelmed by fear, I slowly headed back towards the group. The light of the moon was no longer visible either. It was like something just filled the area with darkness or, rather sucked all the light out of it (if that makes any sense). As I was walking without being able to see anything, I tripped on a rock and fell on the ground. The flashlight fell right next to my face. As my friends approached me, the flashlight suddenly turned back on, illuminating the front of the abandoned house. That’s when we saw it! A little fair-headed doll, its pigtails adorned with red dotted ribbons, all covered in what looked like blood, was standing on the window ledge. We all freaked out, and the girls started screaming when the doll simply fell out the window for no reason whatsoever, followed by a weird metallic screech as it hit the ground. We had no choice but to grab our backpacks and run home. After a few days, a couple of older friends of ours came with us to investigate the house. They were clearly amused by our silly ghost story and didn't take us seriously. We’ve searched for hours, yet we found nothing there. However, when we were walking down the path leading to our abandoned campsite, we saw a trail of dried blood drops leading just off the main path into the thicket. The droplets grew farther and farther apart, and we eventually lost track of them. Shortly after that, a wolf howled at the moon, and judging by its loudness, it seemed to be quite close. As we were rushing back to the path, one of our older friends tripped over something and fell face-first into the dirt. We saw a red dotted ribbon next to his face, quite similar to the ones the doll had. As we dug through the hard gravel, we came across a hand, a little girl’s hand, covered in dry blood.

In my four year career, I had never scored higher than a second class PFT, I never went to my MOS’s advanced school, I was NJP’d twice and non rec’d for promotion more times than I can count. I barely picked up Lance Corporal, and everyone gets promoted to Lance Corporal. According to my Squad Leader, Section Leader, Platoon Sergeant, and Company First Sergeant, I have an “attitude” and “motivation” problem. They weren’t wrong. I don’t truly know why I would behave the way I did, maybe it was just a lack of maturity. I joined the Marine Corps when I was 17, trying to get out of a bad situation back home. I had a troubled childhood, and I had hoped the Marines would be a way for me to move forward. Well, as it turns out, people with troubled childhoods will typically have troubled adulthoods. Every shitty thing I did as a kid, I did as a Marine. Drinking, stealing, getting into fights, being disrespectful to authority figures, typical bullshit you’d expect from a shitbag terminal lance. By three and a half years in, my leadership had given up on me. Whatever, I thought, I only had six months left anyway. Our unit was getting ready to set out on its yearly field exercise at a training area a few hundred miles away from our base. I’m not going to name what unit or base I was at, or the training area for the sake of operational security. I guess old habits die hard. As I expected, as soon as we arrived at the training area, I was placed on camp tax. For those of you not in the know, camp tax is essentially where the unit would place all the shitbags such as myself to do bitch work around the cantonment area. Picking up trash, cleaning toilets, working in the chow hall, and other such tasks. What I didn’t expect was to be placed on AHA watch. AHA means “Ammunition Handling Area”, and in accordance with USMC regulations, it’s far as fuck away from everything else. I, along with nineteen other Independently Minded Marines were given two-man tents and several boxes of MRE’s and were placed in a 7-Ton heading several miles away from cantonment. What makes AHA watch so shitty is aside from the fact that it’s in the middle of nowhere, (which says a lot, because the training area itself was also in the middle of nowhere) is that we had to sleep outside (this base was in the mountains and it got cold as fuck at night) and there was no hot chow, no showers, no bathrooms aside from the overflowing porta-shitters, and most pertinent to me, no PX. I had only brought out one pack of Marlboros before we had left our base, and I had zero snacks. I would have to sustain myself solely on MRE’s for the next month and a half. Not to mention the fact that my only company would be almost two dozen shitbags and all of the wild goats that lived out in those mountains. On the ride over, I pondered what I could have done to be condemned to this forsaken duty. There was a long list of things to choose from. Was it because I fell asleep on duty? Was it because I got kicked off the last rifle qual range for being a safety violator? Was it because I wrote “FUCK POGES” on the wall of the Radio Battalions barracks? I concluded that it was probably a combination of all three. As soon as we got to the AHA, a wide dirt field inundated with green shipping containers filled with various types of ammunition, we quickly set up our tents. As soon as we were done, we were put to work unloading the containers. Alpha Company had their first range in a week, so obviously we had to get their ammunition ready now. After several hours of toiling, we finally finished, and I shambled back to my tent to unwind. This was my daily routine for the next few weeks. Wake up, shave, eat chow, remove ammunition from shipping containers, unload spent shells and cartridges from the backs of JLTVs and 7-Tons, load the aforementioned ammunition into the aforementioned JLTVs and 7-Tons, eat chow, go to sleep. Rinse and repeat, day in, day out. After one particularly grueling day of indentured servitude, all I wanted to do was smoke a cigarette. I had been pretty good at rationing them, and I had one left. Sergeant Hart, the NCO in charge of the AHA, had promised us that he would get us a ride back to cantonment so we could go to the PX, so I could restock then. I walked back to my tent and right away I knew something was wrong. My tent was open. I scurried over and looked inside. My cigarettes were gone. Fucking thieves, I thought. As I pondered what I was going to do, I heard laughter. I glanced over in the direction where it came from, and I saw Davidson standing in the smoke pit, smoking a cigarette. I knew for a fact that he ran out of smokes a week ago, and no one here liked him enough to give him one of theirs. Rage growing inside of me, I stomped towards him. In hindsight, I could have handled that better. I won’t go into too much detail, but the situation ended with Davidson being taken back to cantonment to see the Corpsman and me being put on firewatch all night. I was going to have firewatch for multiple hours every night for the rest of the time we were out there. Fuck. Sergeant Hart made me the roving watch, so I had to walk around the perimeter of the AHA for three hours every night. This was a position he specifically created just for me. After a few nights of this, I was joined by Davidson. He ended up being alright, all he had was a black eye. He was going to join me every night on roving watch because he instigated our fight by stealing my cigarette. It was a little awkward at first, having to spend several hours every night walking around in a circle with a guy I knocked out, but after a while the awkwardness dissipated, and soon we were talking and laughing like old friends. Him bringing me a pack of Marlboros to make up for the one he stole certainly helped. A few days after we were condemned to firewatch, something peculiar happened. A wild goat was found dead outside the AHA. The goat was discovered about two hundred meters down the road from the AHA. It was a ghastly scene. It was all torn up, its limbs were stripped of flesh almost down to the bone, and the strangest thing to me was that its head was missing. Because it was discovered on the road, everyone’s first assumption was that it was hit by a truck. But that didn’t make any sense, the speed limit on these roads was fifteen miles per hour, and it was highly enforced by the chain of command. With how much the road winds and curves, I don’t think any military vehicle could even go beyond twenty miles per hour. A truck hitting a goat at fifteen miles per hour wouldn’t do that kind of damage. After Davidson and I hauled the goat off the side of the road, everyone quickly forgot about it, writing it off as some sort of strange anomaly. Things continued normally for a few more days, until another goat was discovered in the same state as the first. Someone postulated that there may be some sort of wolf or coyote in the area, and that what had killed the goats. That would make more sense than our first theory, as it did look like some sort of animal had gotten to the goat. But like our first theory, there were problems with it. According to our wildlife safety brief, the goats living in the training area were an invasive species with no natural predators. The state had to occasionally bring in hunters to thin their numbers. Someone else suggested that perhaps a hunter was responsible for the goat’s death, but we quickly dismissed that idea. Hunters weren’t allowed to hunt while there were units training. This went on for the next few days. Dead goats, all mutilated beyond recognition, were turning up around the AHA. Every time, they were discovered a few dozen meters closer. I suggested to Sergeant Hart that we should call the COC and tell that what was going on, but he flatly refused. Apparently, Sergeant Hart got into some trouble because of the fight I got into, and now company leadership was questioning his competence. He was up for promotion to Staff Sergeant, and didn’t want another incident out here to jeopardize that. I tried to protest, but I stopped myself. I knew from experience that an argument between a Sergeant and a Lance Corporal only ended one way. More days pass, more maimed goats, their corpses inching closer and closer to our sanctuary. During our watch, me and Davidson would try and see what was causing the depopulation of the local goat community, but we never could. It was too dark, our tiny flashlights only shone so far, and our NVGs were back in the armory in cantonment. It was a complete mystery to us, until one night. During our watch, we were talking, just shooting the shit, when we heard a shrill scream. It sounded just like a person. We both jumped and spun toward the direction of the scream. We both let out a sigh of relief to see it was just a goat, standing on a hill, illuminated by the moonlight, about twenty meters away from us. Those old YouTube videos are right; a goats scream sounds just like a human. Davidson started to approach the goat to scare it off, they weren’t allowed in the AHA. As he was halfway to the goat, yelling at it to go away, the goat was suddenly pulled away behind the hill by something we didn’t see. Davidson did an about face and sprinted back to where we were standing and passed me, leaving me there standing frozen in terror. The goat kept screaming and screaming until eventually it was silenced, presumably by whatever had taken it. I stood there frozen in place, too stunned by what I had just witnessed to move. My trance was only broken when Davidson grabbed me from behind and tried to pull me back into the AHA. He must have realized I hadn’t been running with him, and he came back for me. We immediately woke up Sergeant Hart and told him what we saw. He didn’t believe us, or at least not completely. He told us that it must have been a wolf or coyote or bear, and that it wouldn’t bother us because they were afraid of people. He knew damn well that none of those animals lived out here; he just didn’t care. He told us to get back on watch or he would make this last week we were here a living hell. Me and Davidson begrudgingly went back on post, but this time we didn’t talk or joke around, we just lay in the prone, our unloaded rifles pointing in the direction of our unseen enemy. We found what was left of the goat the next morning, just behind the hill. All day the next day, we begged Sergeant Hart not to put us on watch outside the perimeter of the AHA. We argued that it was unnecessary from a security standpoint, as there was a tall fence that surrounded the AHA. He told us that he didn’t care, and that it was our punishment for fighting each other and embarrassing him. We then offered to stand firewatch the whole night, every night, for the last few days we were here, just behind the fence. Me and Davidson both sighed in relief when he agreed to those terms. It was exhausting having to stand a full eight hour shift every night for the rest of the week, but it was worth it. We had hoped what Sergeant Hart had said was true, and that whatever that was, it would be afraid of people and not try to enter the AHA. It never did, but we were glad that we would be leaving in a few days so we didn’t have to find out if it would. Things were looking up, the field exercise was over, I had survived being out in the wilderness for a month and a half, and as soon as I got back to our base, I would be starting the process of getting out of the Marines. Things were good. Everything went to shit on that last night. The night had started pretty good. Sergeant Hart had decided that after a month of constantly being on watch, we had learned our lesson, and he gave us the night off. I went to bed that night, happy to be getting the first full eight hours of sleep in since we got out there. My slumber was interrupted by something I had become accustomed to, Sergeant Hart’s angry screaming. “What do you mean, he’s gone?” Sergeant Hart barked at the young PFC. “I-I don’t know, Sergeant! I looked inside his tent to get him for his watch, and he was gone!” The PFC stuttered back. Private Lock had a pretty hard time in the Marine Corps, and that’s saying something coming from me. Lock had trouble adjusting to the rigors of life in the infantry, and to make a long story short, he couldn’t do it. Since he had arrived at the unit a few months ago, he was the constant victim of bullying and hazing. To cope with this, he turned to self-mediation. He popped on a piss test right before we came out here, and he was due to be kicked out with an other than honorable discharge when we returned. According to one of the other Marines present, Lock had mentioned that he was going to go AWOL and catch a flight back home. The Marine thought he was joking and didn’t think anything of it. Now, a few hours later, Locks tent was empty, and his daypack was gone. “Great, this is the last fucking thing I needed.” Sergeant Hart growled. He than turned to me and said “You, Davidson, and PFC Dumbass here are going to go find him and bring him back.” I immediately objected. “Sergeant, you can’t be serious, it’s the middle of the night, it’s dark as fuck out, and we don’t know which way he went! We need to call this in!” I didn’t mention the real reason I didn’t want to go, because I knew he still didn’t believe me. “Fuck no!” Sergeant Hart snapped. “If I call this into the COC, I’m fucked, which by extension, means you’re all fucked. Shit rolls downhill!” I doubted that any of this could be blamed on the rest of this, aside from the guys who previously stood firewatch and didn’t stop him from leaving, and the guy who heard Lock mention he was leaving and didn’t say anything. For the first time in my Marine Corps career, I was entirely blameless for a bad situation. Sergeant Hart could tell I knew this and sighed. “Look, he couldn’t have gone that far, and if I had to guess, the idiot probably took the main road back towards cantonment. If you move quickly, you’ll catch him. I can’t go because I’m the NCO in charge, I can’t leave the rest of the Marines here unattended. For all I know if I leave more people would run off.” Sergeant Hart gave me a pleading look. “Aside from myself, you’re the most senior guy here, I trust you to get this done.” In hindsight I shouldn’t have let that convince me to go. I should have grabbed the radio myself and called it in, and let Hart get fucked over, but I didn’t. Throughout my time in the Marines, I had always been treated (deservedly) as an incompetent individual who couldn’t be trusted with any sort of responsibility. So having a Sergeant give me and actual important task and tell me he trusted me to complete it convinced me. After all that time, despite all my shitbaggery, I still had some sense of motivation. Myself, Davidson, and Scott (The PFC who discovered that Lock was missing) sent out down the dirt road back toward cantonment, the route Sergeant Hart had believed Lock had gone. Davidson had agreed to go with me because he figured that there was strength in numbers, that whatever was out there killing the goats could have killed us all in the AHA but didn’t, because it must have been afraid of large groups of people. Scott came with us because he was a boot and would do whatever the fuck we told him to do. Sergeant Hart told us that if we didn’t find Lock within an hour, we could call him on the 152 and then he would radio it in as a last resort. At the time that felt reasonable. As we made our way down the road, me and Davidson kept our heads on a swivel, on the lookout not only for Lock, but whatever ungodly nightmare that may be lurking in the shadows. It was a cold night, like always, and for once, the sky was clear of clouds. It had almost been an hour since we left, and all three of us were ready to call the Sergeant and tell him we had failed. I brought the radio to my ear and pressed the key-in button. “Echo Five Hotel, this is Echo Three Tango, radio check” I said into the radio. Static “Echo Five Hotel, this is Echo Three Tango, radio check” I said again. Static “Echo Five Hotel, this is- “ I was cut off by three loud beeps emitted from the radio. I looked at the radios display to see the bar representing the radio’s battery life was just a small sliver. “Fuck!” I exclaimed angrily. I exchanged a glance with Davidson. “Did uh, you happen to bring an extra battery?” I asked. He gave me an annoyed look. “You’re the one carrying the radio, you’d be the one in charge of having batteries.” I sighed. He was right. Damn it, the first time I was ever entrusted with something important and I already fucked up the most basic thing. No wonder I kept getting Non rec’d. “We should probably head back!” Scott piped up. “Sergeant Hart is expecting us to call him soon, and if he doesn’t hear from us, he’ll assume something happened. If we run, we can probably get back in twenty minutes.” “He’s right.” Davison chimed in. “If Sergeant doesn’t hear back from us, he’ll be more pissed than before.” I reluctantly agreed. I knew Sergeant Hart would be angry that we couldn’t find Lock, but at that point, I didn’t care. I was getting out in a few months; soon all of this would just be a shitty memory to add to my collection of shitty memories. “Alright, let’s get- “ I was cut off by a shrill shriek that pierced through the night air. All three of us turned and faced the direction of the noise. Standing on top of a small hill adjacent to the road, illuminated by the moonlight, was Lock. He looked ragged and dirty, like he had just gotten out of a two week field opp with zero rest and his uniform was torn to shreds and covered in blood. He was panting and gasping for air, like he had just run a marathon, and he on his knees, like he had just crawled up the other side of the hill. “Lock, you dumbass boot!” I said, ignoring his disheveled appearance. “Where have you been! We’ve been looking everywhere for you!” I growled at him. I really don’t know what had come over me, perhaps it was all the anger and frustration building up over my entire mediocre career, compounded by the month and a half spent out in the field, finally boiling over. I laid into Lock. “When we get back to the AHA, I’m personally going to fuck you up, then Sergeant Hart’s going to fuck you up, and then when we get back to cantonment, I’m going to- “ My tirade was cut off by the animal that pounced on Lock. That’s the best way I can describe it, an animal. Although it didn’t look like any animal I had ever seen. If I had to describe it in greater detail, I say it was a cross between multiple different animals. It had the head of a bat, the body of a man, and the claws of a mountain lion. Claws that were currently tearing into Private Lock’s torso and ripping out his spine. Me and Davidson immediately booked it. We ran back down the road towards the AHA. After about one hundred meters I realized Scott wasn’t with us. He must have done what I did the first time I encountered this thing and froze up. I turned back just in time to see the creature decapitate him. I gagged and tried to resist the urge to vomit, which was not helped by the fact that this was the fastest I had ever run in my life. “Where’s Scott?” Davidson panted. “It fucking killed him!” I gasped back “Hart should have let us bring our fucking rifles!” Davidson angrily exclaimed. Davidson tried to convince Sergeant Hart to let us bring our rifles and some ammunition, but he refused, he didn’t want to risk us losing them or having a negligent discharge. He insisted that if there was something out there, it probably wouldn’t bother us. He was a Sergeant, so he knew better than us. It felt like we were running for hours, but in reality, it must have only been a few minutes. I could see the lights of the AHA, we were so close. I figured that if we made it back, we would be safe, because it never tried to get into the AHA before. Maybe it did fear large groups of people. We just didn’t bring enough with us. I noticed in my peripheral vision that Davidson had fallen behind me a bit. Davidson was not a good runner, the whole reason he was on AHA duty was because he failed the PFT. After a few more minutes of running, he fell to his knees, gasping for air. “Oh my god, fuck…” He panted. “I can’t go on, I can’t breathe…” I stopped and screamed at him. “Davidson get the hell up! We’re almost there!” “I can- I can’t breathe…” He looked up at me with a pleading look. “Throw me on you-your back and carry me.” I looked down at him and assessed the situation. Davidson was a big dude, and I was a pretty scrawny dude. Carrying him would slow me down tremendously. There was still just under a kilometer between us and the AHA. There was a chance I could get back to the AHA with him on my back, there was also a chance I wouldn’t. I looked down the road. The bat human hybrid was sprinting towards us. Even from a few hundred meters away I could see its blood-soaked fangs. We had a head start on it because it spent a few minutes devouring Scott’s corpse. I was very winded at this point, and I realized if I wanted to survive, I would need another head start. I’m ashamed to admit it, but I left Davidson behind. My leadership was right, I was a terrible Marine. I had done the one thing a Marine is never supposed to do; I left another Marine behind to die to save my own life. Davidson kept screaming my name as I sprinted away from him. After I made it a few hundred meters away, he abruptly fell silent. I dashed through the front gate of the AHA, almost knocking over a very angry Sergeant Hart. I didn’t stop to listen to whatever bullshit he was about to spew at me, I headed straight for the main radio. I pushed the boot radio operator to the side, picked up the microphone, and without any radio etiquette in mind whatsoever I screamed “Help!” over and over again until I passed out. I was later told that I passed out from heat exhaustion, but based on the bruise on the back of my skull and the migraines that I suffer from to this day, I suspect Sergeant Hart bludgeoned me over the head with his rifle. My plea over the radio got some attention. When I woke up, I was in a naval hospital. As soon as I was awake, a nurse came in and told me to stay put, and that someone was going to speak to me. Before I could ask her for more information she turned around and walked out. I tried to get up, but that’s when I realized I was handcuffed to the bed. A few minutes later, a man in a suit entered the room. I don’t think I’m allowed to go into full detail about what we spoke about, but what I can tell you is that officially, Private David Lock, Private First Class Lewis Scott, and Lance Corporal Matthew Davidson were killed by unexploded ordinance when they wandered off into the training area. I was told that I would be added to that casualty list if I didn’t sign some papers saying that this was the case, and that I wouldn’t speak about what I had experienced that night. I was told that everyone else present at the AHA was signing similar papers. I had no choice. All he told me about the creature I saw was that they were aware of its existence and that the situation was under control. I left the Marine Corps a few months after that. By the grace of God, I somehow got out with an honorable discharge. I tried to forget that night and move on with my life. I started college, got a part time job, I even took up reading as a hobby, which is something I never thought I’d do. This was all several years ago, and I thought I moved past that night, and my time in the Marines as a whole, but recent events changed that. I kept in contact with a few of the guys who were there that night. Surprisingly, most are still in the fleet and are now NCO’s. We didn’t really talk about what happened, most of them didn’t really get the whole story. The whole real story anyway. A few months ago, someone posted an obituary in our group chat. It was for a Staff Sergeant Daniel Hart. According to the obituary, he was killed in a training accident at the same base where all of this shit went down. At first, I thought it was karma at work, after all, he was the one who sent me and my friends to our deaths so he wouldn’t get in trouble. But a few weeks later I saw on Facebook that another one of the Marines who was there that night died. According to the memorial post on Facebook, he had died from a congenital heart defect. I couldn’t believe that, that Marine in question was a PT stud, and I doubted he could have been in the Marines for as long as he was without any symptoms showing. As the weeks went on, I kept seeing obituaries and memorial posts popping up, all for the guys who were at the AHA that night. The causes of death were all crazy things; car accidents, training accidents, undiagnosed medical conditions, stuff like that. By my count, I’m the only one left, which is why I’m writing this. I don’t think I have much time left. For the past few days, I’ve been locked in my room. I’m afraid to go outside. I’m being watched. From my window I can occasionally see a black van drive by, I know it’s the same one every time from the license plate, and I swear I can hear a helicopter fly by every so often. Helicopters have never flown by my apartment before last week. I’m praying to God that this is all just one big coincidence and that I’m just losing my mind. What I do know that if this is all real, I’m not going let them make my death look like an accident. I am perfectly healthy, I don’t have any dangerous hobbies, and my job isn’t dangerous. I am not planning on hurting myself. If they come for me, I’m going to fight. They won’t be able to make it look like an accident."}

Cathleen had a bit of a twinkle in her eye; devastating as cases could be, they seemed to have a certain effect on her. Some thought this was the signature of a sadistic woman, who joined the police force only for the fear of the law, but the days were different from others, law did not quite have the people under its thumb. Perhaps it was true anyhow, but she was lieutenant and a good one regardless of whether she felt personal gratification at the sight of blood or not. She found herself lying awake in her bed, breathing heavily and talking to herself. She had no idea what the dream had been about, but she knew it had terrified her. She tried to close her eyes again, but the unfound paranoia kept her awake. After about twenty minutes of shifting positions and adjusting pillows, it was her decision to remain perfectly still until her sleepy eyes shut themselves and took her back into the land that harbored dreams. Then again, though she was sleepy, she didn't know if she could dare to step into those planes again. Now, she felt, only waiting for irresistible fatigue would do the trick. But for a mind filled with fear, it was not an easy task. “That is, of course, if what he says is true.” She went on. “And we can’t truly place him in the position of a suspect. It seems to be a case of self-mutilation, but why would the victim -and I say victim because I’m still not convinced, have a reason to do this to herself?” The projector whirred; a grotesque image of white-and-red covered the screen. Those gathered, the people of the law, felt nauseated at the sight in spite of the fact that they were experienced with corpses. This specific girl had broken the strongest of the officers’ mental defenses, and a little of Cathleen’s courage when she had first seen the corpse. The room was filled with an imaginary scent of decay. Cathleen could only be glad she was facing her officers and not the screen. Others, however, did not have such luxuries. Isabella could feel her mouth going dry, and so were the tears on her cheek. These tears had passed off unnoticed by her before, but now she could feel the salty liquid vaporizing with the hot, dry wind. It tickled her face. It must have been the frightening dream that had caused these tears to run down her nose and temple, but it could have also been the result of the fact that her eyes had been open for a while now. She blinked a few times and sat up in her bed. The night was awfully dark. Remembering the cellular device she had kept under her pillow the previous day, her hand reached for it. It would serve as a source of light, so she could find her way to the kitchen. A young officer raised his hand. He tried not to look at the screen, but he had to, in order to face the lieutenant. The others, happy to have another object of interest to look at, regarded him closely. Her hand reached under the pillow, it searched. Nothing? She thought, confused. Then she picked up the pillow and tried to see where it was, if it were there at all. The warm sweat and drool on her pillow moistened her hand and as the thirsty winds fed on the moisture; she felt cold. She felt with her free hand for her cell-phone. There! She found it. Good, well. Damn! The battery was exhausted. She would just have to travel alone through the dark. And she did. Adjusting her pajamas, Isabella stood up and groped for the door knob. She felt entirely blinded, but before she knew it, she had opened the door and made her way to the kitchen. He was undoubtedly in his 20’s, and had the sickly pale complexion of a person who had spent too much time away from the sun. Despite being new to the force, the captain favored him, and since nobody dared question the captain’s judgment, he was treated with respect (if not a little sarcastic) by his colleagues. Following the officers’ gaze, Cathleen nodded quietly. The switch was right there. She pressed it down with her whole palm hastily, thereby switching on all the other electronic appliances whose switches were around the one she had meant to press down. Now in the warmth of artificial light, she could switch off the ceiling fans and the microwave with ease. But that was not meant to be. The light from the CFL blared out and flooded the room. Isabella could feel a pang of pain in her optic nerves as her eyes adjusted to the brightness. Had the lights been changed? They hadn’t been this bright before or any other night for that matter. Or perhaps it was just the night, darker than that any other. Isabella could almost imagine the sky, cloudy and dark grey, or rather, black, small lights fading behind the clouds like dying fireflies. She walked to the water-filter, blinking rapidly as she did so, wishing her eyes would get used to the glare already. They were little more than narrow slits as she drank quickly. The water going down her throat in large quantities pinched her oesophagus as it went. Sleep seemed like a distant memory. Enough? Isabella could still feel her salivary glands pouring thick, water-deficient saliva into her mouth. Perhaps a little more. This time she was careful to drink slower. She filled her stomach with water until she could feel the unease of a strange wobble inside. Now all she wanted was to go back to her bedroom and sleep; okay, stay awake and be quiet about it. She must have woken up someone with the racket she created while she switched on all the appliances. The golden glow of the microwave stared back at her under the flutter of the ceiling-fan, bathed in another glow that was the local lights. He pushed his chair back in a clumsy fashion, thereby disturbing the utter silence that had followed the revelation of the very first slide in the presentation. Cathleen had put it there for just that. She didn’t need to build up to a mystery. All she needed was a room where she could speak without interruptions as one of the five officers that had been there at the scene of the crime as soon as they were called. And even she couldn’t help but wince at the clumsiness of this bull in the china shop she had set up as an excuse for briefing. Clumsy as he was, he was a brilliant person, and he would soon come to prove it to the rest of the team, but not yet. She headed back to the switches and pressed each one, one at a time, but she didn’t switch off the light. Her finger rested on the switch though, as she considered. Finally, gathering her courage, she pressed down. She found herself pressing again, at the other end. Light was back from the CFL. She found herself wondering why she had just done that. \"Okay\", she thought, she obviously wasn't ready to make her way back to her room through the dark. Not that she was afraid, but she was. She had been for a while. She knew he had returned, and she knew she couldn’t run away again, like she had done a long time ago. She couldn't repress his memory at the back of her mind any more, and she certainly couldn't fall asleep with that memory clawing its way through her subconscious. After all, we recreate a memory every time we remember. He was reborn again and again inside her head. The kitchen opened to the dining-room, and there lay a table for six. A stool had been pulled up there the night before, for the family had had guests, and the chairs fell short for one. Isabella had taken her seat on the stool and eaten awkwardly with people who were related to her but only pretended to care for her. And now she sat again, on the stool, waiting patiently for the night to end, and despising guests. “By the state of her body, she couldn't have possibly done it herself,” he said in a single breath as he stared into the picture at last, disturbed by it but also too stupefied to look away at this point of time. “And why do you think so?” Cathleen stepped into the darkness to let him have a complete view. She suppressed a smile, for she knew exactly why he thought so. “Mum, mum wake up!” Beatrice shook her mother’s shoulder as she slept. It was very early in the morning and Beatrice’s mother was not excited about the fact that she was being woken up, but sensing the emotion in her daughter’s voice, she did so anyway. “What is it, Bea?” “It’s Isabella. She’s awake.” Hearing this, Martha mother was mildly annoyed. She knew her older daughter to be an insomniac, especially while under the pressure of coming exams. Beatrice sensed her mother’s irritation, and she wished to resolve it but didn’t know how. After living in the world for many (though not many) years, her mother had not quite learned the trick to masking one’s annoyance. Finally, finding no way to explain the situation briefly and yet clearly, Beatrice, much to her mother’s further annoyance, dragged her to the kitchen. And thus the situation was explained. “Isa? Are you all right?” Martha approached her with caution. After receiving no audible response, she decided to be sterner with her daughter, who looked like she had stayed up the whole night, and she probably had. “Answer me,” she demanded. Isabella turned to her mother, slowly, mechanically. Her eyes were dark and dull. She broke into a straight, fake smile after what felt like a lifetime. “Why wouldn't I be?” “Why wouldn't you what.” “Be alright. Why wouldn't I be alright?” “You, young lady, need to explain why you look like you were up all night.” \"That's because I was.\" \"Why?\" Martha’s voice shook as she said this, and Isabella could tell. She noticed every bit of everything that was happening in her vicinity. The cold, eventless night had almost changed her. Perhaps it had not been as eventless after all. “You’re blood pressure isn't steady.” “And just how would you know that.” Martha sat back and crossed her hands, silently checking her own pulse and willing it to be slower. “You are scared. And yet you refuse to believe it.” “BELIEVE WHAT.” “Are you going to cry? I’m sorry if I’m making you cry.” Martha did not know what had led her daughter to this, but instinctively, she felt herself blink. A single salty drop of water rolled down her cheek. Before she could respond, Isabella had walked away. As Isabella walked to her room, Beatrice spied her from a crack in the door, afraid of whatever her sister had become. However, Isa knew of this, and just as she turned to the room, just before Beatrice could squeal and run, she bent down all of a sudden and peered back through that crack. There was no sound; Beatrice was too shocked to scream. She scrambled to the corner, away from her sister who now walked into the room. Whispering nonsense to herself, she rocked back and forth, trying to get herself over the horrors of what she had just seen. Inside the bathroom, the older sister looked for a while, and when she found not what she sought, she walked out again, this time, glaring at Beatrice and flashing her a short, sharp smile. Bea, the little clumsy girl, was now chewing her hand, but not really getting anywhere. She would need sharper teeth than that, her sister thought as she left the room. That gave her an idea. But then WHERE did her father keep his stupid razors?! “Well, for one, she wouldn't have finished. The pieces are perfectly diced, as we can all see, and the moment she hit an artery, like the one on her neck, that is the carotid, It would have led to an instant death. And if she had cut off the rest of, um, herself minus the organs of the digestive system before the-“He trailed off and immediately looked away from the screen. “It isn't possible.” “Isa?” Her father rolled over in his bed. She hadn't been noisy at all when she entered her parents’ room, but he found himself half awake. “Isabella, hon, what are you doing?” “Nothing, father, just go back to bed. You’re safe in bed.” Father? He got out of bed, yawning and stretching a while, and then, realizing that the whole house was awake, he grimaced. He had been a heavy sleeper, but how long had he actually been asleep? Turning around, he checked the clock. It seemed to be stuck, and the hour’s hand moved back and forth from 3 to 4, visibly fast. Samuel stared at it for a while, feeling oddly dizzy. The bathroom door slammed shut. “Good points, Harris. But that isn't all. You see, she had no records of a mental condition in the past, not even depression. Needless to say, the scene of the crime was spotless. The neighbors reported nothing unusual, not even screams. No sign of struggle. No drug popped up in the forensics department, at least not yet. And all the missing pieces were found in her mouth and stomach,” she closed her eyes. ”Digested and definitely chewed.\" \"What do we come to now?” Harris sat down, defeated. Everything about this murder, or suicide, was crossing itself out. It seemed as if something else had killed her; something not of the earth. Even as a man of science, he could not shrug off the notion. Then somebody else spoke: “But how, ma’am, do you know that this was the work of a murderer for sure. He could have forced her to do it, but she must have protested.” Then he paused thoughtfully, “Perhaps they were both in it. But it still seems like an extreme, for self-mutilation, I mean.” At this point he realized that he was contradicting himself and sat down abruptly. It stung, it hurt, but that was okay. Flakes of enamel fell into the sink, with a little blood, too. This did not concern Isabella as she chipped off further, staring right into the bathroom mirror as she did. She knew that it would all soon be worth it, in a while. “They seemed to be in it together, but nobody was there in the bathroom with her.” “How do you know? Harris just said that it wasn't suicide. It could have been her family members, most likely her father,” another officer pointed out. “It wasn't.” “What makes you so sure?” somebody asked. “Well perhaps it’s because I was there at the scene yesterday when we were called.” The lieutenant spoke as calmly as she could. She was not used to being questioned. The shock had been hard on her, too, and that was the reason why she was intent on solving the strange case. The other officers weren't there, save for the other four whom she had called upon herself. It had been a national holiday, and they had to see the sight of a girl who had cut herself up into pieces and eat those pieces. She didn't know if she had gathered the officers there so they could share her shock, or solve the case together. \"Unlike you\", she had meant to say, who wanted to enjoy the holiday. It wasn’t their fault, really, she reminded herself. She was called early in the morning on her personal phone and she had the time to bring along only four officers, the best on the force. None of the gathered people were these officers, they, were at home, suffering from the shock and unable to speak. In another room, Beatrice was chewing through her hand. Her skin was rough and she seemed to be struggling. Savagely, she bit further, and the purple bruises darkened. Whatever she had seen in her sister's eyes had changed her completely. But Isabella was far ahead anyway. She shed her clothes and stepped into the bathtub, pleased with the work she had just done. She sighed. “Well, whatever it was, it was contagious. Her sister, Beatrice her name is, is in care right now; they’re trying to keep her from nibbling at her hand. Her mother hasn't ceased crying, and the only person who can talk is the father. It’s clear that he’s in shock too, but he seems to be convincing himself that he saw somebody inside. No traces were found though, not even fingerprints.”' “So someone could have been there?” “I have interviewed everyone related to the crime scene. I can assure you that the possibilities of a person being there are few.” “What other information have you gained from the interviews?” “The father’s interview was interesting, actually. While the others -and when I say others, I don’t mean the other family members who haven’t yet said a word- had nothing much to say. Calm day, no sounds, nothing suspicious at all.” “What did he say?” Cathleen pressed a button on the remote. “… Something downright frightening.” Someone pounded on the door. All Isabella had really wanted was solace. Now the entire household (but for her sister, who was still drooling over her hand and never getting anywhere like the silly girl she was) was outside the bathroom, screaming her name. “WHAT,” she shouted back, “do you want?” “Open the door. NOW!” “I’m bathing,” she gurgled through the blood. “OPEN THE DOOR ISABELLA.” No one had noticed the low hum of the projector just yet, but now the room had attained a whole new level of silence. The slide faded, much to everyone’s relief, to a new one. And it was then that they realized that the next slide was less disturbing, but even more. It was a drawing, a harmless drawing of a man sitting beside a bath-tub and holding a piece of flesh close to his mouth, as if he were cherishing the smell of his meal. The walls of the bathroom were sprayed with red. His clothes, a ritual robe, perhaps, seemed to be untouched by the thick, crimson liquid, if not a little muddy and creased. ...But the robe was the least of the unnerving aspects of the man. One of his eyes was scarred, and both were held upon purple sacs that were the distinguishing features of a man devoid of sleep. He was a staring portrait, one of those optical illusions that can look at the viewer no matter where he runs. He also seemed to have an aura about him, depicted artistically by fading details as the objects moved away from his influence in the drawing. “This is what he said he saw.” The lieutenant paused. She believed in a snappy briefing and even quicker justice, but here she felt like a person narrating a story as the listeners sat around a camp-fire and ate burnt marshmallows. “Artist: Isabella Smith, and one hell of an artist too. Object: her imaginary friend from long ago.” This slide faded too, leaving others wondering what it would be. “These, ladies and gentlemen, are her drawings over the ages.” A little girl with a triangular body and crooked lines for limbs, holding the hand of a grown man with a scar across his eye; the same strange man in the middle of the playground, out of place in the whole picture; a forest with the same little girl walking with the man, but she did not seem so happy; her in chains, very detailed chains, with the man sitting there, just staring; herself again, disembodied with several faceless kids glaring down at her flesh and pieces. Each drawing was better than the last, and finally the same one again, with the man at the bath-tub, his scar fresher than ever. Samuel flung himself at the door. It remained put. However, contending himself on the fact that he had done some damage if any, he tried again. This time, the lock shook. Inside, Isa wondered why he bothered at all. What was done was done. She just hoped the lock would not break before she could finish, that it would not fail her in this lifetime. Haha, a lock with a life. Funny. The door bulged one more time, and the lock gave in. Isabella cursed it under her breath, whatever breath she had left, and sank into the tub as her father barged in. Maybe it was the shock that kept him, or maybe Isabella was just too fast for the intricate design she had carved out that day, on both time and herself, but he was just too late. Too late for both his daughters, one demented, the other dead in the bathtub. But then again, she had been dead for quite some time now, precisely three hours. The projector screeched. The slides started to play again, from the beginning. This, Cathleen thought, was not part of the briefing, or rather, story. She pressed frantically at the buttons on the remote, and finally after several failures, she walked up to the switch and pressed the reverse end of all switches. The air was filled with a burning smell; the projector was destroyed. And suddenly, there was darkness. Suddenly only darkness. One could still see the after-image of the picture, glorified with blood. The room was cleared. The police had half given up on the case already, for despite themselves, it savored of the supernatural. Even the lieutenant, who hadn't anticipated this, was afraid. The case, she knew, would be passed off as murder on grounds that Harrison would put forth. Or maybe it would be passed as suicide if the post-mortem was hidden from the masses. Either way, it would be covered up, and it would be made to seem like the police had solved another mystery. That's how law usually goes; another innocent hanged for the sake of the police's reputation, and Cathleen was okay with that. It made things simpler. She couldn't do anything about it if she wanted. Not this time; not ever. The man at the bathtub greeted Isabella’s father with a smile. It seemed that the case was Isabella’s and hers alone.

That", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Mental Illness", "Mirrors"], "content": "“Strange how paranoia can link up with reality now and then.” ― Philip K. Dick, A Scanner Darkly My name is Connor. Up until today, my life was completely normal...well, as normal as you can get. I’m your average 25 year old male who graduated from the University of Washington a little over two years ago. I was born January 23rd, 1989 in a small town in Maine called Belmont. Fewer than 1000 residents, but I loved the place. The only reason I came to Seattle was because of all the great job opportunities after college, but like all my other plans, things didn’t go the way I’d hoped. I’m currently working at the Bank of the Pacific in Seattle. It’s your normal bank holding company, it’s fairly boring, but it pays well and I appear to be good at it. But it isn’t what I wanted to do. I graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. I wanted to become a programer; maybe make it famous as a man who created the next big thing, like John Carmack. But in the end, I landed the job at this bank. Not really the most entertaining life-story ever, but I guess I’m not the most entertaining person in the world either. Today was Friday, and for the first time in a long time, I actually had after-work plans. My friends and I were planning on going to see a movie later tonight and head out for drinks afterwards. To a lot of people, this might not seem like the greatest night ever, but I’ve gone three months without having a night out with friends, and I needed one badly. But out of all the stuff I’d be doing tonight, there was one thing I was looking forward to even more. This girl I like, Reyane, will be tagging along with the rest of us. And who knows, maybe if I make a good impression on her, next time it might just be the two of us? It had been a while since I had even thought about love. I remember having a girlfriend in high school; we dated for around three months before she told me that it wasn’t going to work out. I hadn’t had a girlfriend since, not because there wasn’t anyone I liked, but just because of how I took the breakup. She had it a lot easier than me. I won’t be going into details as it just brings up too many bad memories. It’s been years since then, so I think it’s about time I give dating another shot. As I started walking out of the office, I noticed the amount of police cars in the area. There were people gathered around to see what was happening, but the police didn’t appear to be giving any information out at the time. It was probably some kind of car wreck, or a fight that broke out. Either way, I had to go home and get ready, so I made my way to my car. I own a blue 2004 Audi S4 Sedan, and I am one of those people who get overly-attached to their car. It might not be the newest or most in-shape cars out there, but this car has been with me for years now. I get in the car, pull out of the parking lot and head out. I had arrived at my rundown apartment complex at around 3:30. The place wasn’t in the best of shape,didn’t cost much, but was home for now. I had just graduated when I first started living here, and at the time, it was all I could afford. A few years have passed since then and this place makes me happy, and it has some other benefits as well. My apartment is at the end of the 2nd floor hall, room 208. I put my key in the lock, only to find that it was already unlocked. It’s this terrible habit I have, leaving the apartment unlocked from time to time. The dorms I used to live in at the college I went to had automatic locks, so I never needed to get used to locking it manually. My apartment itself was nearly as bad as the exterior; I admit, I was a slob. I had clothes lying everywhere, garbage next to the trash can (not in it, but literally sitting next to it), my bed wasn’t made, dishes were piling up. I was living the carefree bachelor’s life. The only thing I actually cared for was my home entertainment system. It had a Samsung 60 inch Plasma TV, a PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, surround-sound speakers all over the living room, and my giant stack of DVDs and games. It cost me a fortune, but like I said, owning a dirt cheap apartment has its benefits. I started getting myself ready. I thought that it’d probably best if I wore clean clothes tonight, because from all the magazines I’ve read, girls aren't attracted to guys who wear the same pair of pants for an entire week. I decided to throw some clothes in the washer and dryer, and took a shower in the meantime. About 30 minutes before I was supposed to leave, I was in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, enjoying the thought that soon I’d be at the movies with everyone. I’m staring into the mirror, brushing each tooth individually, counting each stroke, kind of like in that movie... what was it called? “Stranger Than Fiction”? Yeah, that was it. I’m nowhere near as insane as Will Ferrell is though. As I continue brushing my teeth, I get a sudden chill. Have you ever gotten the feeling that you were being watched? Like someone was right behind you without you knowing? Like anyone would do, I take a look around me just to make sure that I wasn’t being watched, even though I knew no one was. It’s like getting soap in your eye while taking a shower, you close your eyes for a few seconds, but then get the feeling someone is behind the curtain. As I look back into the mirror, I catch the slightest glimpse of a shadow outside my window in the living room; well, at least I thought I did. I knew it wasn’t possible, this was a second floor apartment; getting up here would be difficult. I brush the feeling off and finish brushing. I still had some time to kill, so I sat down on my pigsty of a couch and turned on my television. A news report was on about the serial killer that’s been on the loose, and how there had been another murder... right outside my office. This was the third victim in the past 2 weeks. Reports say that each of the victims' families had been showing signs of insecurity, like they were being followed by someone. A chill runs down my spine. That’s what the cops must have been doing as I had walked out of the building. Just the thought that a serial killer was anywhere near me gave me terrible thoughts. To get him off my mind, I started channel surfing. Nothing really good was on. I flipped to AMC, and it looked like they were airing “The Rock”. It’s been years since I’ve seen that movie, but I can’t get lost in memories now; I gotta head out. Before I walk out the door, I took one last look at myself in the mirror and started posing like any guy would do. Yup, irresistible. What girl wouldn’t want all of this? All of the sudden I heard something; kind of like the creaking sound you get when you walk on wood. And it had come from my closet. The building was old, someone could walk on the floor from at least 20 yards away and hear it from where you’re standing. I walked over to my closet, just to make sure nothing was in there, and opened it. Just like I thought, nothing. I closed the closet, headed out the front door, remembering to lock it this time, and went down the stairs. There were a group of teenagers hanging out near the entrance to the complex, and my neighbor’s dog was barking like crazy. It does that whenever it sees people it doesn’t recognize. It gets annoying at times, because despite the few people that live in this building, we get a lot of visitors. Sometimes the dog will wake me up at night when a group of joggers jog past. Either way, I drove to the entrance and the teenagers made way for me to pass. On the way to the cinema, I was being honked at by some idiot in the car behind me. I was going the speed limit, what did he want from me? That’s when I checked the mirror to see who the guy was. That’s when, for a second, I could have sworn I saw a face in the mirror; not my face, but someone else’s. It was the briefest glimpse of one, but as soon as I saw it, the face was gone. I rubbed my eyes a little and blamed it on being tired. Being at work so early probably wasn’t the best idea, especially if it’s starting to make me hallucinate. I was about to consider going home to take a nap or something, but I had arrived at the cinema, and there, standing outside, were my friends waiting for me. Reyane was there as well. Once I saw that beautiful black hair and her smile, I knew I couldn’t waste a night like tonight. I found a parking spot and met up with everyone. Apparently the movie had been delayed due to some problems with the projector, so it looked like we were going out for drinks early. We all decided to carpool and head over to our favorite bar, Kell's. We ordered a few rounds of our favorite ales, and like the young people we are, start chugging them down. I had been hesitant to do so at first. I didn’t know if Reyane would find chugging beers to be a turn-on for her, but to my surprise she was chugging along with the rest of us. If the bartender hadn’t enforced the “two drinks per customer” rule, we’d all be drunk and die in a fiery car wreck on the way to the theater. I silently thanked whoever made that rule. Before we left, I looked behind the bartender at the mounds of ale and liquor on the walls. That’s when I noticed a mirror behind all of the drinks. I could scarcely make out a man standing right behind me. I couldn’t see his face clearly. When I turned around, there was no one there. This time I blamed it on the alcohol, but just to make sure I asked the bartender if he saw a man behind me a second ago. He replied that he hadn’t. I really need to figure out a way to stop these hallucinations from occurring. As we arrive at the cinema, my friend Jeff hands us all of our tickets. Up until this point, I had no idea what kind of movie we were going to go see. After the ticket-taker handed me back my movie stub, I looked down at it to check. Oh God no. Reyane comes up to me, noticing my expression. “Scared?” she says as she smiles and walks towards the theater. I knew I couldn’t pass off this eerie feeling, cause now I’m more paranoid than ever. The theater was having a “Horror Feature Night” and my friends thought it’d be a good idea to go see a horror movie called “Mirrors”. It was about a serial killer who used mirrors to, like, teleport through them and kill his victims with ease. Now, I know that movies like that can’t possibly happen in real life. But you can’t blame me for not wanting to look at another mirror for a while, especially with the hallucinations I’ve been having today. It would've been nice if my friends could've given me a heads-up on the movie we were going to see. On a brighter note though, there was one good thing that had happened tonight. Reyane had such a good time with me that we scheduled another date to go out for dinner next week, and this time it’d be just the two of us. We had it all planned out; we’d meet each other next Friday night at Olive Garden (just like me, she loves Italian food), maybe catch a movie if it hadn’t gotten too late, and after that...who knows? On the way home, I’d noticed how foggy it had gotten. Usually I wouldn’t think about it too much, but it’s the middle of summer, and here in Seattle we don’t get too much fog due to the city lights and everything. It was actually starting to creep me out on top of the recent bizarre events. I’ve never been the biggest fan of fog. Tons of accidents happen due to the idiot drivers who forget to turn on their lights and end up colliding with another car. But driving alone in the fog after watching a horror movie can make you paranoid beyond belief. I might not seem like it, but I am a horror movie expert. Everything I’m doing at the moment is screaming “Code Red!”, but there was no one I could really drive home with. If I had asked Reyane to come with me, that might had given her the wrong idea and ruin all chances I had with her. The drive home was really quiet; it hadn’t been that late at night. There are usually people driving down the streets until at least midnight. With all of this freaky stuff that’d had happened today, I might actually be in a horror movie myself. Then, upon instinct, I checked my rear-view mirror... Did you ever watch the television series, “The Twilight Zone”? I distinctly remember an episode about a girl who decided to take a trip across the states, and there would always be a man popping up everywhere, just out of the blue. There, sitting in the back, was a man. At least, I think it was a man. He was covered in a silhouette of darkness, but the figure looked like that of a male. For 10 seconds, I just stared. I couldn’t speak, move, or even breathe. I just looked into the mirror and watched as the man sat there silently. I quickly turned around, only to find nothing but empty fast food bags and other garbage. This was getting out of hand. I couldn’t handle what was going on, my mind couldn’t comprehend what was happening. It wasn’t my brain's fault. I can’t blame it on being tired anymore, because at that moment, I was wide awake. And all I could think about was getting home as soon as possible. I sped up, and in a matter of minutes, I was home. I checked in my side-view mirror this time, and about 30 feet away, I saw a distinct figure walking slowly to my car. I got out of the car as fast as I could, and bolted up the stairs to my floor. I look over the railing. This time I knew he was real. I see him by the car, slowly walking towards the stairs. He was after me. I started pounding on all my neighbors’ doors, begging for help, but no one came to help me. I looked over my shoulder; the man was walking up the stairs. I ran to my door, bolted into my apartment, slammed the door shut, got into my closet, and just waited. It felt like an eternity. I waited in that closet, hoping for some sign that I would be okay. I heard the neighbor’s dog barking outside my apartment, and that can only mean it sees the man as well. Hearing this meant that I was not going crazy; he is, in fact, real. What was going to happen to me? Was he going to kill me? Then the barking stopped and everything around me went cold. I heard footsteps on the other side of the wall. It was him. It had to be. I kept praying to myself, hoping that everything would be alright. The footsteps stopped right outside my front door and I realize something... Had I locked my door?"}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Nice_Play", "title": "Untitled", "author": "Unknown", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Monsters"], "content": "Hey, my name is Jake. I'm twenty years old, and I want to tell you about an \"accident\" that happened about ten years ago. I was only ten at the time, and being the person that I was, I was very, very curious. My curiosity could lead me to doing stupid things a lot. But, one day, I did something that I didn't think was stupid. And boy, was I wrong. So, it was a normal, boring day in class. Math, Lunch/Recess, Literacy, Social Studies, more Math, Lunch/Recess, art, then the end of the day. But, at the end of the day, we were asked to put these forms in our planners. They were forms, for a play. We could \"audition and have the time of your life, or stay at home doing nothing but play video games.\" I, as a ten year old \"cool kid\" wanted to boast about being the only person in the class to go to the play. All of my friends said, \"That's your choice,\" and I'd just say \"Yes, it is.\" Three weeks later, it was finally time. My parents drove me to the auditioning place, I did my act, and I did good. I passed. He said to wait another week and your parents/guardian would drive you to the theater. One week was like one years at that point, so I just did normal things until that time. On Monday, after school, my mom drove me to the play. The outside looked like shit, but the inside looked beautiful. I was in the backstage, getting my costume on. Twenty-three minutes later, when all the people arrived, they play started. I can't remember what it was about, due to things that you will hear later in the story. So, the actors started the part, a man dressed as a girl came out, and the play was normal. I finally had my act, and when I came out, everybody cheered. I guess I was a hero, or something. I remembered the script, \"attacked\" the bad guy, and won the fight. Only thirty-two more minutes. I was having the time of my life, performing, and the main character was talking to me, when suddenly, the lights went out. I tried to look for a source of light, but couldn't find one. I heard a scream, near me. The lights went back on. It was the main character, dead. His throat was ripped open, empty, no blood. No blood at all. I screamed, ran around, then fell down. The lights went off, and something grabbed me. It threw me against the table, I hit my head, fell over, and it grabbed me. I tried to kick, but failed. I tried again, and it worked. A hideous shriek was heard, and I covered my ears the second it started. I hear a noise. The thing wasn't dead. I ran around and the lights came back on. Somebody was also dead, but their stomach was cut open, and there tongue was pulled out. And, there was still no blood. I grabbed a hammer, but just then, the lights shut off again. I started swinging the hammer around as hard as I could, until I hit something. I heard a splat, and the same shriek. The lights went on. I puked at what I saw. Something, pure white. With organs, intestines, hell, even kidneys all over it. Still no blood. I ran out of the stage room, and went into the lobby. I heard a loud scream, but not from just one person, it sounded like half of the audience. I went outside, and found my mom waiting in the car. I cried, and begged her to take me home. She put me in the car, I buckled my self in, and we drove off. And, when we were driving, I saw the same creature. Pointing at me. I have recovered from the incident since then, but I can still remember it. Sometimes I wonder where that creature is right now. Is it outside my home? Or watching me when I sleep? I don't know, but I always know, that no matter where I am, it will point at my direction. Or directly at me."}

I was unwilling to leave my bed and curled myself up into the blankets. I felt the warm fabric move across my exposed skin as I turned myself into a human burrito. But as much as I wanted to stay in my cozy cocoon of fabric, I knew I had to get up and face the day. After dozing for a few minutes I reluctantly unwrapped myself, stretched, and hopped down off my bed. I turned on my light, undressed, and headed into the bathroom to take a shower. My eyes were only half opened, and I moved mostly on muscle memory as I shuffled to the shower and pulled back the curtain. I turned the handle. As usual, the water came out icy cold. I held my right hand underneath the water until it started to feel hot, and then I stepped into the shower. I like my showers very hot, and this one was the perfect temperature for me. I closed my eyes and relaxed under the hot stream, feeling the water hitting my back and neck. Steam swirled around me, and I let the shower begin to ease me awake. A particularly large drop hit my back and rolled down. It startled me, but the shower head had been known to leak and drip on occasion so I shrugged it off, grabbed the soap, and began to wash. Eventually, another big drip hit my back, and this time the drop did not roll down my back. Then another stuck. And another. And then that first big drip clinging stubbornly to my back started to itch and tickle and make my skin crawl. It crept up my back to my right shoulder. I turned my head to see a large, brown spider; almost as big as a 50 cent piece, sitting there inches from my face. I screamed and batted it away with my left hand, only to see another clinging to my left forearm. Each time I brushed one away, I felt new large drips and found new spiders. I became more and more panicked, frantically slapping them off of my skin. I realized where they were coming from. I turned and looked up at the shower head. What had once been relaxing hot water was now a shower of spiders raining down on my head and my face; jumping, crawling, biting, and spinning their sticky webs. I screamed, and they crawled into my mouth to choke me. I fell in the shower coughing, sputtering, and flailing, lost in a heap beneath their twitching and scurrying forms. I woke up flailing and feeling like my skin was crawling. I was convinced there must be a real spider on me, and I began to smack at my arms and legs. I beat myself black and blue, until I finally had the courage to throw off my blankets so I could check if my skin was clear. It took me a while to calm myself down. It was only about 3:30 when I woke up, and I wasn't able to fall back asleep until almost 5. My mother opened my door as she did every morning. “Cory, time to get up.” It was 6:30, and I had to get ready for school. I was unwilling to leave my bed.

I took martial arts", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Beings"], "content": "Like most of my peers, I earned my driver’s license at the age of sixteen. With that, of course, came the desire to use it; to see my town and the surrounding world for myself, and to go places, do things and be someone. Being young, however, I didn’t have much of a plan, and driving without aim would be little more than a waste of gas, in a time and place when gas prices were less than favorable. Because of that, I wasn’t quite the explorer I had imagined myself being. That is, not until I began my morning routine at least. I was never weak, by any means. I took martial arts, and pride myself in being able to personally kick the collective daylights out most of my male friends. Despite that, I wasn’t the strongest either, and a recent pandemic and extended lockdown had left me a bit more out of shape than usual. This combined with the recent desire to impress a girl pushed me to find some way to get myself into shape. The trouble was, I had tried regimens and schedules in the past, but nothing ever seemed to stick. You could reasonably chock that up to my own poor attention span, to be honest. Because of that, I was looking for some creative ways to stay in shape while also having fun. The main problem was that my previous exercise routines always seemed like chores, which never failed to deter me. That was when it hit me. My town was surrounded by dry, stony hills and mountains on all sides. There was no shortage of trails nearby, and despite my poor physical shape, I was indeed an enthusiast of the outdoors. A daily hike up a nearby hill, I resolved, would be the perfect solution to my problem. I could enjoy some time in nature and slowly work myself into shape--two birds with one stone. So, from that point on, I rose first thing every morning and drove a couple minutes down the road to the foot of the nearest trail. The first time climbing that mountain was a huge breath of fresh air. I felt that cool spring morning breeze, and I saw the waist-high yellow grass swaying in the wind. I heard my feet stomping against the thin dirt trail, and the sound of birds chittering nearby. It felt like heaven. I remember reaching the top of the hill, out of breath and sweating all over. It was an uncomfortable reminder of just how unfit I was, but was quickly swept away as I began to take in the view. From the summit, I could see almost the entire town below. It hit me then. Now that I was sixteen, that entire town was open to me. It felt huge and miniscule simultaneously, as I also considered the size of the outside world. That changed everything. Suddenly, I was outside daily. Not only was I getting stronger, but I was thoroughly enjoying every single moment of it. That hill almost became my home away from home, in fact. Every day I’d stomp my way to the top, only to make my way back down again. All the while, I listened to the noises of the mountain. There were very many of them, in fact, there were more than one like myself might initially expect. I doubt I’ve even heard them all. Every time I walked, I would listen for these noises, and associate them in my mind. Every time I heard a new one, I would search for it and record it in my mind, now knowing that much more about the hill. There was the soft rustling that the tall grass made each time a breeze blew through. There was also the sound of birds chirping and calling out to one another--probably the most common sound. Sometimes I would hear the faint scuttling of a lizard that had been basking on the trail until my clumsy footsteps had frightened it off. Sometimes it was that, but with a rabbit instead. As rabbits are larger, their noises were louder, and I learned to tell them apart without too much difficulty. I also heard odd clicking noises coming from the bushes or trees. I never found any birds to associate them with, so I instead decided that they must have been produced by bugs of some sort. Noises were what made that hill come to life, in a way. Even when I couldn’t see the animals that lived nearby, I could hear them, which still gave the surrounding area an air of life. One day, a day I won’t soon forget, I was walking along the trail when I heard a new noise. It was midday, and the sun was shining strongly. I almost refused to hike in such heat, but I had made a commitment and vowed to follow through. I was halfway up the steep and strenuous trail when an unnerving sound reached my ears. It was a loud, dry, rhythmic rattling noise that started and didn’t seem to stop or even break for a second. I had never heard it before in my life, yet it put me on edge. There was something deep within me that instinctively knew what that sound meant, even if it didn’t register in my mind. The one thing I knew was that I was in immediate danger. I froze, not daring to venture any farther up the trail. Instead, I slowly began to back away, never once turning my back on the noise. I knew that sudden movements would be foolish, so I forced myself to remain calm, despite my fear. As I backed away, the noise grew faint before stopping altogether. I calmed down, but knew that it would be foolish to finish the trail. Instead, I turned and slowly walked away, my ears now searching for any similar noises. I knew I was safe now, but that feeling of unease never truly left me, and every time I hiked after that, I was more wary than I was before. That was my first time encountering a predator. That type of encounter--that type of noise--is one that leaves a lasting impression. Even when the creature isn’t large enough to eat you, knowing that something with the ability to severely wound you lurks just out of sight is a terrifying feeling. Back then, I didn’t immediately register that a rattlesnake was making that noise, or how close exactly it was, but I knew just from that sound that the best thing to do was to simply back away. Predators are frightening creatures, and their presence should put anyone on edge. Healthy fear is a wise thing to have. Of course, I did continue hiking after that. One snake wasn’t enough to make me give up on my workout. But as spring turned to summer, and the days grew hotter and brighter, hearing that rattling noise became more and more common. Sometimes it was softer and at a distance, but sometimes it was so close that it seemed to flood my ears. Now, the hill had more than one trail, and I was perfectly able to take alternate routes. After a while though, I grew sick of that and decided to remedy the situation more properly. I began hiking early in the mornings, or later in the evenings when the temperature cooled off. My logic was that, since snakes are cold-blooded, they’d be less active at the cooler times. And, well, it did work. At least, it did for a while. I must admit, I grew especially fond of the evening walks. Feeling the temperature gradually fall and the light slowly dim was relaxing. I could hardly get enough of it. One night, however, you could say that I jinxed myself. One evening, I set off as the sun was setting. There was a slight breeze, and the temperature was fair. I would even go so far as to say that everything was perfect. As I walked, I noted every sound. A couple of birds chirping. A rabbit scuttling into the bushes. Two rabbits. Then three. Crickets sang out both in large choirs and as stunning soloists. By the time I reached the top of the hill, the sun had gone down almost entirely, and looking at the town below was like looking at Christmas lights. It was stunning. I couldn’t help but smile to myself. The rattlesnakes may have forced me to walk later, but I realized that it had been well worth it. This was so much better than any midday hike could ever hope to be. After around ten minutes of gawking, I decided it was time to head back to my car and get home. As I did, I realized the trail had grown dark, and seeing it might be a little tricky. Of course, that was no real issue, as I had become well-acquainted with the trails by this point, but it still made me just the slightest bit easy. I began my descent, but something seemed off. There didn’t seem to be anything outright wrong, but it felt like something was missing. Then it hit me: I could feel the eyes of something watching me. I couldn’t tell where they were or what they belonged to, but I could feel something eyeing me. I began to quicken my pace as a pit formed in my stomach. It was just a hunch, but my instincts were telling me to flee. As I moved, I realized something else. The crickets, the birds and the rabbits were gone. They made no noises. All was dead silent. As soon as I realized this, my heart rate began to rise. I was no expert on wildlife, but I’d been told in the past that when the creatures around you go silent, that means something else is out there. Something predatory. Suddenly, running seemed like the worst possible idea. Instead, I had to move slowly and calmly. I could not afford to agitate whatever was crouching out of my sight. As I moved though, I felt my body tremble and my breathing become uneasy. This wasn’t like what I felt near that rattlesnake. Snakes don’t normally prey on humans, and will normally only bite if they feel threatened. This was something else. I was being hunted. It was deliberate, malicious and filled with killing intent. I tried to be calm, I really did, but I found myself hyperventilating. I was certain that I could hear a very soft shifting noise out in that grass, and I was certain that with every breath I drew, it crept ever so slightly closer. I was halfway down the hill, and beginning to lose my mind. I’m not really sure why. Perhaps some part of me realized that I could be mere seconds away from death, and wanted to avoid that. As I desperately attempted to calm my breathing, however, something new emerged from the grass. It was the sound of soft breathing, no more than five feet away from the sound of it. It was somewhat raspy, like whatever it was hadn’t had a drop of water in decades. That was a new noise. As soon as I heard it, I stopped holding back. I tossed away all reason and ran. It was too close. I couldn’t let it creep any closer. I had to run while I still had that option. Running downhill is a poor idea, but I was desperate to escape. I know that it may have been the most moronic thing to do in that situation, as most predators tend to be able to outrun their prey, but I was in a frenzy and could no longer be stopped. While I ran, I could hear something begin to moan. It was a bizarre call that was neither human nor beast. It croaked out with a low, dry voice and began to rise in both tone and volume. Soon, it had reached a high-pitched shriek that seemed to split the night. Like I said before, it wasn’t human, but that was no animal either. At least, it wasn’t one I’d ever heard anything about before. That voice seemed to awaken something, however, and I soon began to wish that I’d just stayed put and stayed calm. As that strange sound rose to its climax, more voices seemed to join in. I couldn’t tell where they were coming from exactly, but they were all around. Each voice started at the same exact pitch, rising until it matched that of the leader. They started at different times, staggering the noises, and it seemed like a new one was joining in every second. The noise was constant, as though they had no need to take a breath at all. I opened my mouth to yell in terror, but I couldn’t even hear my own voice over the sounds they made. Those voices seemed so full of rage, yet I didn’t understand why. I couldn’t even begin to comprehend them. The only thing I understood was that the amount of danger I was in had just increased tenfold. This was most certainly a new noise. They seemed to be everywhere. With every stride of my desperate attempt to flee, more and more voices joined in, seemingly growing increasingly close. I was almost to the bottom of the hill now, and only had to run a hundred or two feet before reaching the trailhead where my car was located. At that point, the screams were flooding my ears, seemingly right behind me and right at my sides. I couldn’t tell if they were running, or if they were staying put and letting their cries disorient me. As I ran, my vision began to blur, and everything around me seemed to bend and warp. I’m not sure if this mirage was an effect of the screams, or if it was simply my own fear. I realized that I was teetering, slowly losing balance. Suddenly, a sharp pain shot through my leg as something slashed at my right ankle, then at my calf. I screamed again, but of course, it was inaudible compared to the cacophony that surrounded me. Then something nailed my left hand. I’m not sure if it was a fang, a claw or something else entirely, but it hurt. With those sudden attacks, I felt myself lose what little was left of my balance, and my body tumbled into the dirt trail. I tried to scramble to my feet, but everything was moving so slowly, like forcing my way through a pool of honey. It was almost like running in a dream. I managed to make my way to my feet again, but everything had blurred and warped to the point where I could hardly discern what was around me. I felt dizzy, like I would collapse again at any moment. The pain in my arm and leg felt like it was spreading, working its way through my entire body. Everything felt surreal but that pain. Up ahead, not fifty feet away, I was able to make out the trailhead I was almost free. Something latched onto my back, but I managed to shake it off. It had been the size of a medium-sized dog, but with six long fingers at the end of all four limbs, and bare skin that was like ice to the touch. I didn’t get to see it, and I didn’t want to. As I got it off, another leapt on, screaming in my ear and momentarily deafening me. Once more, I was able to shake it off, but not before something sank into my shoulder. I think it was a sort of mouth, but with long, thin teeth like sewing needles. They sank into my skin without resistance, but seemed impossible to remove. When I did throw it off, I felt it take a small chunk of flesh from my shoulder as well. It hurt like nothing before. Then one grabbed onto my leg. With my free foot I aimed a kick, which seemed to break its body with relative ease. It crumpled up and released its grip, and I kept on running. I passed the trailhead and headed for my car, stumbling again as I attempted to reach for my keys. I pressed the unlock button, slid my thumb through the key ring, and reached out for the door handle. As my fingers wrapped around it, I felt several more latch onto me and attempt to drag me away. I yanked the door open, kicking and thrashing wildly as I forced my way free of the creatures and into the car. As soon as I was in, I slammed the door shut, locked it, inserted the key and started the car. As I flicked on the headlights, I saw several dark shapes scatter, adamant on avoiding the light. I put the car in gear and began to drive, while thousands of six-fingered hands slammed and pounded on all sides of the car. I could still hear the shrieks outside, constant as ever. I turned on the radio, switched to the loudest rock song I could find, cranked the volume as high as it could go (which, mind you, was quite high) and fled that neighborhood at nearly forty miles per hour. I heard thumping noises as the creatures were thrown off. The music was blasting so loudly that I could no longer hear their screams. I had probably permanently damaged my hearing, but that meant nothing to me in the moment. I didn’t even bother to look at the things. I didn’t want to know what I’d see. Still feeling dizzy and dream-like, I guided my car clumsily down the road. My whole body was in pain. Somewhere along the line, I swiveled into the wrong side of the road and smashed into the side of some Volkswagen. Everything was a blur as the police questioned me. As my parents lectured me. The pain in my body was all I could feel. The blurred, warped shapes and colors were all I could see. I could only hear soft, muffled noises, no matter how loudly anyone yelled. At that moment, I just wanted to die. Nobody was killed in the accident, and I don’t feel like recalling the specifics of what happened after. My body is scarred where those things bit and clawed at me, and black spidery lines mark where the pain seemed to crawl. Over a couple days, my vision returned to normal, but my hearing was never the same. Even now, I’m almost completely deaf. It’s a bit of cruel irony, really. I had fallen in love with the noises on that hill, but now I’ll never hear a new sound again. I no longer hike there. I no longer hike anywhere, for that matter. Nobody questions me when I stubbornly refuse. I never go out at night anymore, either. I did once, and that alone scared me away from it. Well, for a year or so, at least. Whenever I went out at night, no matter where I was, I began to hear those screams again. They would start low, then begin to rise. It shouldn’t be possible. I’m deaf now. But that never stops them. I regret everything, now. I regret so much as stepping outside. I’m miserable, and nobody can console me. Do you have any idea what it’s like to live without noise? Especially when you can vividly remember every sound from when you could still hear? It’s disturbing, to say the absolute least. Doctors tried everything, of course, but nothing worked in the end. It’s utterly miserable. After a while, I craved noise. I listened to it every chance I got. Even though all I could hear was those screams, after a year or so of avoiding them out of fear, I began to seek them out of desperation instead. Every night I began to wait outside for those cries. I smile as I listen, their voices growing ever so closer. Once I see the shadows moving in the dark, I go inside, my deaf ears still ringing. That’s the only thing that gets me through the day anymore. Knowing that at night, I’ll be able to hear something again. That’s why I’m outside writing this. The screams are getting louder and louder, and I see shapes shifting in the dark. I think they’re coming for me, but I never really knew if they would kill me, or if they just wanted to taunt me. Maybe I’m just going insane. Nevertheless, I can’t go on like this. I think I’ll wait for now, and see what they do. Before, I was too scared to find out, but not anymore. And if these really are my last moments, well… at least it won’t be silent."}

It sat right next to their one-story house. They had a small child who was six years old. The boy's name was Johnny. Johnny was a quiet boy who would take care of the livestock with his father. Johnny would feed the chickens as Thomas would milk the cow that his son named \"Betsy\". Marie would stay inside the house and she would tidy up the place. The family would hear howls in the middle of the night. Thomas told Johnny that a monster lived in the woods. He said that it would come out at night and kill the deer. Thomas was an avid hunter. He would grab his shotgun and go out into the woods almost every day. When Thomas would get back, they would eat whatever game Thomas could find. Johnny always wanted to go hunting with his father, but Thomas said that it was dangerous to go out into the woods. One day Johnny got curious. After his father left, he decided to go out into the woods. His mother thought that he was just going to take care of the livestock. Johnny walked into the woods and looked up at the trees; he saw an owl up there, watching him. Johnny walked past the owl as he looked back at the bird. He stopped walking as they made eye contact. Johnny stopped looking at the owl and continued walking. The trees were tall and thick, Johnny felt as if the trees were looking down at him. Johnny was walking as he briefly saw a deer laying down behind a log. He stopped moving and focused his eyes on the animal. The deer was dead. Its eyes were lifeless, but they seemed to be pleading for mercy. Johnny was feeling a small amount of unease crawl into him as if a bug crawled into his ear and planted fear into his brain. Johnny thought that his father would find him, or that his mother would call his name, \"Johnny, Johnny are you okay?\" Those words rang out in his mind like the screeching of a bobcat. Johnny didn't know where he was. Johnny was lost. He suddenly heard the snapping of a twig behind him. Johnny saw the trees looming over him, the glowing eyes of the owl staring him down. Johnny turned around as fast as a bullet. His bright blue eyes widened when he saw it. It was a humanoid squatting towards the ground. Its skin was snow white and completely hairless. It was the size of a black bear and one of its three-fingered hands was laying on top of the now broken stick. Its other hand was in mid air, as if the thing was crawling towards Johnny. The thing's face was completely blank except for a wide, gaping maw. It was standing still, like a statue. Johnny tried not to blink while backing up, slowly. It just stood there, not moving a muscle. Johnny called out, \"Mom! Dad!\" His eyes started to tear up as the creature twitched slightly with a loud cracking noise accompanying it. It started to creep closer to the boy as he tripped on a root and fell on the ground. Johnny looked around for a moment and then picked up a small rock. The creature sniffed the air as a small nostril above its mouth made a whistling noise. Johnny then threw the rock to his left; it landed in a stream with a splash. The creature looked in the direction of the stream and darted towards it. Johnny got up and started to run back to the house. He didn't look back. He saw the fields of grass and the barn in the distance. He heard a loud shrill noise, louder than a mountain lion's roar. Johnny ran out of the woods and into the barn with the livestock. Johnny fell to the ground and rolled into the fetal position as some of the sheep started to panic. Betsy walked over to him cautiously, never seeing Johnny behave this this before. She mooed at the boy, trying to comfort him. Johnny looked up at Betsy and told her to stay quiet. Johnny then realized that it was dark out; it was a new moon. He laid there in the hay for what seemed like hours, with some of the hay going into his light blonde hair. He heard a growl come from the roof of the house. He saw his mother walk outside of the house with a lantern in her hand. \"Johnny, where are you?\" she asked. Johnny wanted to reply to her, but he didn't want to give away his position. The creature crawled down from the top of the roof, slowly, like a snake slithering towards a mouse. Marie walked down from the porch and called her son's name as the creature's long arm reached out towards her. Johnny and the animals silently waited for the inevitable. Johnny looked around for a rock to throw; there was nothing. Suddenly, a gunshot boomed from out in the woods. It was Thomas, alone, far out. The creature's cover was blown as it screeched and turned around as it ran off into the woods. Marie turned around as she screamed and collapsed on the ground. Johnny ran out of the barn yelling, \"Mommy!\" Marie was speechless as her son ran over and hugged her like they hadn't seen each other in years. Marie looked at her son straight in the eyes and said, \"Hide under your bed, your dad will be back soon, just stay quiet.\" Johnny nodded his head as Marie signaled for him to go into the house. He opened the door and slammed it shut as Marie hid under the porch in a small crawlspace. Johnny ran into his room and crawled under his bed. Thomas was in the woods; he saw a wild buck right behind a big tree. Thomas then heard a low clicking noise. Suddenly, the buck ran away as the creature ran in Thomas' direction, clumsily running into a tree. Thomas dropped his gun and ran in the other direction as the creature tried to remove a splinter. Thomas ran towards his house as the creature stood up on two legs and started to run towards him, gaining up on him. The creature's two-toed feet left massive footprints in the ground as Thomas started to breathe heavily. The creature tripped and started to run on all fours, giving Thomas a head start. Thomas ran back to the house and repeatedly banged on the front door. \"Thomas, down here!\" Marie yelled as Thomas looked down to see her under the wooden porch. Thomas then crawled under the porch and hid in the crawlspace. The creature lunged out of the woods and landed right next to the house, burying its claws in the dirt. \"Thomas, do you have the gun?\" Marie asked in a whisper. \"Oh good God, no, I don't have it,\" Thomas replied. They both knew that it was too late now. \"I shouldn't have went out at a new moon,\" he said. \"What are you talking about?\" Marie replied. \"I've seen that thing before, and I saw what it can do to deer,\" her husband whispered. \"It only comes out at new moons, so it could hunt in the darkness.\" \"Well whatever it is, I don't want it doing the same thing to us,\" Marie said. The creature scratched its long, blood red fingers against Johnny's bedroom window as the child whimpered under his bed. Its hand then suddenly broke through the glass as Johnny screamed and ran out of his room. Thomas then saw a long, rusty pole on the ground that was about five feet long. He grabbed it and crawled out from under the porch. He stood up as it started raining. He yelled at the top of his lungs, \"Hey! If you want to take my son you have to take me first!\" The creature lumbered into view. It roared at Thomas as it rushed towards him. The thing's mouth was wide open; this was Thomas' chance to strike. He ran up to the creature and rammed the pole down its throat. The creature twitched and convulsed violently as blood spurted out of its maw. The creature fell on the ground as it let out a pained gurgle. Johnny ran out of the house and Marie crawled out of her hiding spot. They all hugged each other as the moon appeared in the sky. Everything was pitch black for a moment. Johnny then saw that the creature wasn't there. Thunder boomed and lightning struck, as Johnny saw footprints and a trail of blood leading back into the woods.

Dotted around the store are a bunch of mannequins wearing either fashionable clothes with children’s characters on them or costumes to be like their favorite characters. Every few weeks, the store changes. Literally, nothing stays in the same place for more than a month. The dolls can take up an entire section of a wall in one month and then occupy a small freestanding fixture the next. This means that the mannequins move around all of the time too. One night, about a month back, we broke two mannequins. Much to our dismay, and our boss's, we needed to buy a couple of new ones. Our boss was livid with us because apparently, those things cost about two grand each. Two fucking grand for a fake kid. Anyway, the two new ones arrived a few days later along with one of our deliveries for the week. I carefully picked up one of the mannequins and took it to where it would be put on display the next morning and asked one of the girls I was pulling the delivery in with to grab the other one. When I returned, I saw she was dragging this other new mannequin across the floor while still wrapped in a protective bag. “What are you doing? Just pick it up, it’s not that heavy,” I said, mockingly. “Oh, yeah? You try!” she said with a wisp of bite to her words. I gladly swooped down and picked up the mannequin, although it was not with the ease with which I first assumed I would pick it up. This thing weighed a lot… a lot more than the first new mannequin. It was so heavy that I had to lift the thing up onto my shoulders just to spread the weight across my body enough to carry it the whole way. I carefully lowered it back to the ground and propped it up against the wall with the other new mannequin. Oddly, this new mannequin didn’t have detachable extremities. Usually, they all come with two detachable arms and one detachable leg in order to dress them easier. I always had found that a little creepy too. They all have eyelashes. This one didn’t though which, looking back, seemed a bit odd, but I never gave it a thought at first. I left a sticky note on the thing saying to install that new mannequin first when the morning team arrived for work and that it would be at least a three-person job due to the weight and the height it needed to travel. I even questioned whether or not our glass shelving would be able to withstand the weight or not on the note. That day was one of my days off. I got a text from one of the guys helping out that morning that read as follows: “You weren’t kidding about that mannequin being a three-person job… it took two ladders and four people to get that thing secured in and up there. What’s that thing made of, iron?” I sent a reply giving them all props for even getting the thing up there. So, a few days went by and everyone forgot about the mannequin situation… that was until I noticed the shelf it was standing on. The glass shelf, which is safety glass, so it’s thick, and the two metal arms holding it up, were beveling under the weight of the thing. How had no-one noticed that? I immediately told my manager and he said that it should be fine until we close, then we could take it down. When the time came, he entrusted me to do this alone. I showed him the text I received from one of the guys who installed the damn thing and he just looked at me as if to question my masculinity. Yeah, my manager was a “men should be men and women should be in the kitchen,” type of arsehole. Watching him talk down to people always riled me up but when he did it to me I had to heavily suppress the urge to flat-out punch the guy. So, he’s cashing up, one of the girls I work with is tidying the store and I’m trying to take this mannequin out of the wall, and fuck me, was I struggling. I couldn’t even detach this thing from its metal holder never mind take it down. After what felt like an hour, I managed to lift the thing up and I immediately became teetering on the ladder. Even with my colleague holding the thing still, the weight of me and the mannequin seemed too much for the top of the ladder and physics wanted to kick me in the nuts that day. We both went flying from the top of a nine-foot ladder. There was a comedically loud slam on the ground and I blacked out for about two seconds. I was brought back around by the shakes from my colleague. I was able to stand up and when I did, I noticed two things. Firstly, my head was killing me and felt like I’d just gone three rounds with Brock Lesnar in an octagon. Secondly, there was blood on the floor. My colleague told me to stoop down to her level so she could check my head for any wounding. There wasn’t anything there. That was until we saw the that the blood on the floor was still pooling and that pool was getting bigger by the second. The blood was coming from inside the mannequin. “What the fuck?!” we both said in unison. I flipped the mannequin into a face-up position on the ground and surveyed it. There was a big hole in its head now and looking inside I can only describe what I saw as a mixture of flesh, bone and brains. I started picking at that cracked hardened plastic around the face and, when I did, my suspicions were confirmed. Underneath the mannequin's face was the face of a person. Not just any person… a fucking child. I and my colleague recoiled in horror and she ran to tell the manager. He came over and looked like he’d just seen a ghost. His reaction was the most flamboyant I’ve ever seen come from him. He said he was going back to the office to call the police. After fifteen minutes of standing around with the dead body of a child encased in plastic on the floor, I went to the office to check on him. Through the little window to the office, there was no sign of the manager. I ran around to the back door to find both of the double doors swaying in the wind, and the space in which his car occupied was no longer filled. The manager had fled. We then called the police, fearing that he hadn’t, and they arrived within minutes. We gave our statements and went home. I have yet to find out anything that’s happened and it’s been a month. The only thing I was told by the police though, was that my manager still hasn’t been found, and after searching his home it’s clear that this man was twisted enough to kill a child and then display the body like a trophy. In fact, there were targets listed on his walls. Keep your children safe, people. And next time you look at a mannequin on a shop floor or shop window. Look extra close… it might not just be a big hunk of plastic. Inside could be a whole other level of twisted. Written by TheDarkRemark Content is available under CC BY-SA"}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_New_Life", "title": "Untitled", "author": "this time", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Beings", "Music"], "content": "Alright, so about three months ago, I finally moved out of my parents' house and into the unpredictable and mostly unforgiving world of adulthood. I was eighteen by this time, and more or less optimistic about what the adult life had in store for me. A good majority of people are at this age, but odds say that this taste of independence will end up truly being the greatest fear of all young adults. That far away and nearly fantastical age we dream of as kids suddenly hits us essentially out of nowhere, and look who's the asshole that's unprepared. But anyway, when I finally moved out of my parents' house, I moved into a nice apartment in Philly with a fairly cheap rent. I had had a decent paying job already at Walmart that I had gotten during the summer (Yes, I am very ashamed about that.), and so I didn't have to act as a sort of parasite towards my parents. It was nice living there. It had a simple living room, a kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom. So I lived there for a while, driving to my community college by day, going on the internet and eating like a horrible fucking pig by night. It was routine, and I think it's obvious to say that it got pretty old after a while. But there wasn't much I could really do, being an eighteen-year-old working at Walmart and all. So I came home from school one day, did my typical routine, and went to bed a few hours later. I think it was about 11:30 that I put my blankets over my body, laid my head on the cold pillow, turned off the lights and tried to go to sleep. After attempting to fall asleep for fifteen minutes, I heard something that absolutely scared the shit out of me. Now you have to imagine being in my position; completely alone in the dark, it's near midnight, and you expect nothing but complete silence. The peace was disrupted by a man's voice, a very loud one might I add, and it was coming from the bathroom. And I knew it was coming from my bathroom; it was right fucking next to me. Immediately after my blood pressure rose from the horror I experienced after learning there was an intruder in my home, an immense force of uncertainty and panicking curiosity hit me, as questions came into my head. How did he break in without me noticing? When did he break in? What the hell does he want from me? Why is he in my bathroom? All these questions came only an instant after I heard the voice. I realized only seconds later, after I had collected my thoughts (though only a little), that the man in the bathroom was singing. It sounded like he was mimicking Frank Sinatra, or at least playing his songs out loud for me to hear for God knows why. Every once in a while though, the singing would stop, and I heard the sounds of violent banging on the walls of the bathroom, before the singing started again. I sat quietly for a few minutes, contemplating the next move I would make while still being scared shitless. I knew I would either quickly and quietly get the hell out of there and contact the authorities, or try to confront this stranger myself. For some reason, I really have no idea why, I chose the latter. Maybe it was because I thought subconsciously that this person had violated the very essence of my independence by breaking into my apartment. I owned this place; it was the first thing that belonged only to me. I was going to make this fucker learn this, one way or another. In a rush of exuberance, anger, and yet subtle fear, I grabbed a knife out of a drawer in the kitchen as I heard another set of banging noises from the room. I hesitated after I heard this, losing my confidence in my ability to fight, to defend what was mine, but gradually regained it when I heard the singing again. I had to do this; I had to at least scare this lunatic off. Only if he had a gun would this be a problem. And yet with this possibility now in my mind, I still opened the bathroom door ready to appear as threatening as possible. In the bathroom was a large, naked bald man with no eyes. There was an abnormally large and permanent grin carved into his face as the lyrics of Frank Sinatra came out of it, perfectly resembling the voice of the man himself. He was skinny enough for nearly all of his bones to be visible through his dark, bloody, and seemingly decaying skin. He was swinging to and fro as he sang, like he was dancing gently, yet still very awkwardly, like he was a child learning how to dance for the first time. He towered over me by a few feet, and as my entire body numbed out of disbelief and utter horror at what I was looking at, I simply stood and looked at him as he was singing, dancing, and dripping blood, his own or someone else’s, onto my floor. A few seconds later, he convulsed violently at an impossible speed while inevitably banging his head on the walls and flailing his arms around like they were rubber. He then took control of his arms again, and viciously and slowly tore off a piece of his skin while still convulsing, with each gash revealing an eye lying within, gazing at me with agony in it and a stream of tears coming out, before slowly sinking back into the covers on his body that was his skin. He had stopped singing only for those few seconds to make what sounded like low-pitched and grotesque sobbing, before singing again once the convulsions stopped. I dropped the knife, picked up the phone and dialed 911. \"911 what's your emergency?\" \"I... there's...\" \"I'm sorry sir, can you speak up?\" \"I... don’t...” \"Sir, are you alright, can you tell me where you're calling from?\" It was then that I dropped the phone, and walked out the front door of my apartment. I kept walking without any thought as to where I would go. I just kept walking, and eventually started crying uncontrollably and vomiting the further I went. I thought of absolutely nothing except about what I saw back there, and eventually even that didn't get too much thought put into it. All I knew then and what I know now is that God is dead, and that was His corpse."}

His feet gave a small twitch before going limp. His glasses shattered when his face met the floor, shards lying around his head with his eyes closed, a small, black hole at the base of his neck where the bullet had entered. The others around you ran out screaming towards the door. One of them tried to quickly phone the police, dialing it on the phone before she looked up to see you and ran off to do so outside in fear. You looked down at the murdered body of your best friend, the gun shaking in your hand at the action of it before it slipped off altogether. You backed into the wall behind you, crawling into a fetal position. You reminded yourself that this wasn’t real, this was all a lie. He wasn’t real, nothing was. It was all an illusion, a game that you were not willing to play anymore. After calming yourself down, you finally looked up at the exit. Some stray, morbid thought somewhere in that gone-mad brain of yours made a wise crack about taking the day off that you’ve been waiting for. Your body wasn’t getting any younger even in this world, as you slowly arose yourself to walk over towards the door, and opened them. And you were met with nothing. The blinding light of grey, almost white covered your eyes. Gone were the neighborhood, the people, your car and even the building itself. Nothing remained but an endless, colorless plain. And with little option, you chose to walk through it. After all, you were expecting that you made a mistake and would have to go through this again. But today seemed to be different and you invited that in comfortably. The air was chilling, and large particles of dust moved along the ground as though a mist. Not that there was much to see anyways. You fold yourself in a bit at the cool yet silent winds to provide yourself with at least some warmth, which your worker’s outfit did not provide much of. It felt as if the walk was an eternity. You were afraid that this is how you would now continue existing: just walking without a path. But, soon enough, you could make out a shadowy object in hindsight. You tried to squint your eyes to see what it was, and you could make out a bed with an IV stand next to it. You sat on the side of it. You saw her, your dead wife, lying on the bed with you beside her. She was always the optimistic one in your relationship, you recalled. Her eyes weakly fluttered open, and she gave you a smile. Just give it a few days, she told you when you asked her what you should do, but you knew that those days would never come. Her heart rate monitor grew weaker as you held her hand into yours, and you could feel it slowly wither away… and stop altogether. You slowly got up from the hospital bed, picking up the family picture you always carried around in your wallet on the desk next to it before stuffing it into your pocket. There is something philosophical about this, you thought crudely to yourself. You tried to think of that ancient proverb, and it depressed you further as it came to you. You walked on. In the misty distance, you could make out another object as you walked towards it. It was the water dispenser from your job. A dark spot of blackened blood was still on it when you killed your companion earlier today, and a sudden sense of grief and coldness washed over you as you heard his voice in your head. Are you going to be okay, Stanley asked you like he did this every hour, on every day. I’ll be fine, you responded as you slowly pulled the gun out and started to align it where the head meets the spinal cord when his back was turned and nobody else was looking. Just give it a few days, you assured him as you pulled the trigger and watched him slump over as he died. You stared at the water cooler for a long time before you flipped it onto its side in a fit of rage with a scream, falling to your knees as you cried bitterly to yourself. You sacrificed your life for this, you realized; to escape and refuse to accept your reality. The emptiness that you so selfishly tried to escape from was catching up to you again, filling your mood. The nonexistent walls of this open, grey path felt as though they were closing in on you. Slowly you die – die alone on the inside. To pass from this hell is all you wished. When you gathered enough willpower to continue, you nearly tripped on something dark. You look down at your feet and saw the body of yourself. Your mouth was locked open with opened, glazed eyes staring blankly at the monochrome sky. There was a large hole in the back of your throat, bleeding out from your lips. Turning yourself over, you could see that the wound exited from the back of your head. You looked ahead of you and found that there were more of these bodies around, all similar to each other, if not exactly alike. Each of them represented each day passed by, and you can make out entire weeks of this seemingly endless torture. You hesitated for several minutes before slowly walking over them. You tripped on the dark liquid, getting blood on your palms as you panicked before getting up to go again. In the distance, you make out the last stop of the journey up ahead: your office desk. The chair was placed invitingly behind it, your lunch bag sitting on top of it. You picked it up and slowly opened it as you sat down. You tossed the sandwich aside, watching it fall and spill its contents on the ground as though a murder victim. From the bag you pulled the gun, looking it over. You checked to see that it only had one bullet inside of it; just one more death to go. Only one more person has to die… right? You squeezed your tired eyes shut, along with the trigger of the stuffed gun in your mouth, seeing a flash of bright light before all existence faded to the familiar dark you have come to know all so well. And you woke in a cold sweat from your dream, looking around the dim bedroom with a fright. You tried to recall, but found that you could not remember anything, so you passed it off as just a nightmare.

She decided that those would be worth looking into later on.\n The rest of the afternoon was much of the same", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Historical Archive", "Music", "Items/Objects"], "content": "The attic was extremely dusty and smelled of some form of mold, but at the very least, it had a window at the end which illuminated the area enough to see. Unfortunately, all Cam saw was boxes upon boxes, undoubtedly full of the most useless plethora of ancient items in existence. She sighed to herself, thankful that she hadn’t inherited her mother’s pack-rat ways. She picked a box at random and opened it, releasing a cloud of dust. After a short sneezing fit, she began sorting through it. As she had suspected, there wasn't much to see. Most of the box’s contents seemed to be old magazines. She had more luck with the second, which contained several old photo albums, probably owned by her grandmother. She decided that those would be worth looking into later on. The rest of the afternoon was much of the same: open a box, toss its contents into a ‘get rid of’ pile, rinse, and repeat. She was grateful, though, whenever the monotonous work was punctuated by an interesting discovery. An old piece of jewelry here, a handful of photos there; it was dull work, but it was something to do. She pushed aside a box containing several shattered china plates. It was a shame, since they probably would have been worth something had they been in decent condition. She reached for the last box. Newspaper. Old newspaper. She pulled out a piece and tried reading it. It was faded, but she could make out the date: June 27, 1921. Really old newspaper. She pulled out piece after piece of it. Finally, she could see the object the newspaper was protecting from damage: a music box. She lifted it gingerly from its resting place. It was ornately decorated. Curious, Cam lifted the lid of the box. A tiny, intricately carved ballerina stood on a little pedestal, along with a tiny key, which presumably was meant to wind it. Cam knelt there for a while, simply staring at the music box. She gently picked up the key and inserted it into a small hole on the front of the box. She turned the key a few times, making the sound of winding clockwork. She let go and the ballerina began to twirl as music began to play. It was a simple tune; the kind one would expect from a music box. Still, Cam was enchanted by it. She gazed at the spinning ballerina. The rest of the world seemed to slowly fade away. Her mind was concentrated on the music box. Cam was jarred back to reality by her mother’s voice, calling her. She simply alerted Cam that she was heading to the supermarket. Cam gave her okay and placed the music box, which had wound down, back into the cardboard box in which it had been stored. Feeling a little groggy, she decided that she should probably take a break. She grabbed the photo albums from earlier and descended the stairs to the house proper. She sat down on a couch in the living room and began flipping through one of the albums. A few minutes later, she caught herself humming the music box’s song. Odd, since she wasn’t normally the kind of person who was prone to humming. Yet, she didn’t stop herself. She kept softly humming the song to herself. There was something soothing about it. About twenty minutes later, her mother came home, carrying a pair of brown paper bags in her arms. Cam stood up to assist her mother, but nearly fell right back down. Her head seemed to be spinning. She tried to shake it off. She tried to assist her mother with the groceries, but her help was denied. Her mother made a comment about how she looked pale and should probably head home. Cam made no objection as she slowly exited the house and made her way to the car. She briefly wondered if she was in any condition to drive, but was suddenly distracted. Music. That same music from before was playing, but louder. She decided that it must have been an ice cream truck and got into her car. As she drove home, the music continued to loop in her head. Over and over, it played. She tried turning on the radio so as to tune the music out, but to no avail. It was driving her up the wall. She practically ran into her house as soon as she reached it. She immediately turned on her TV, radio, computer, and everything else that made any semblance of noise; anything to drown out the music. But it just kept playing in her head. Over and over. Louder and louder. Her senses grew numb. Her head felt as though it was going to explode. But the music kept playing and kept growing louder. Summoning all her will power, Cam struggled into her kitchen. She reached pulled open a drawer and fumbled around inside for a moment, finally pulling out a carving knife. Exhausted, she fell to the floor. She gazed at the knife, breathing heavily. The music kept playing in her head. She just wanted it to stop. But it kept playing. Over… And over… And over…"}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Muffled_Curse", "title": "Untitled", "author": "the blindingly bright sunlight of morning", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Monsters"], "content": "Before this whole mess happened, I was just an ordinary reporter, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Catching up on the daily news was my life, and I loved it. Finding out what was going on in the world excited me, but the story about to unfold was more news than I wanted. This is my story… It was about two weeks ago when my problems started. On my way to work, I passed a beggar on the street where I live, and he looked up at me expectantly, hoping for some charity. Ignoring him, I strolled past, but before I could go too far, he grabbed hold of my trouser leg and jerked me back. ‘Please…’ he murmured, barely audibly. Pulling myself away from his weak grasp, I said – ‘Let go, I haven’t got any money on me.’ But as he released his grip, coins chinked in my pocket. I reddened and hurried away. As I put distance between us, the beggar started cursing and he whispered something that carried on the breeze. ‘You should take a walk in the woods…’ The following Saturday, I took a hike near where I lived. The weather was beautiful, and I couldn’t have asked for anything better to clear my mind of stress from the previous week. But as I started back home, I stumbled upon a small wood in the middle of nowhere. I could’ve sworn it wasn’t there before… did I not see it as I came past? I remembered what the vagabond had said a few days before about taking a walk in the woods and shivered. It was creepy – but just a freak coincidence. I tried to walk around, but it seemed to stretch on forever. I couldn’t understand it. There was a well-worn path through one section, however, so I decided to see where it lead. I wish I’d never seen that wood. As I started to enter the wood, the temperature dipped sharply. That’s odd… I thought. It had been warm sun all day. How could it have got colder? I shivered again, but continued onwards. The whole wood was gloomy and foggy, and the trees were mostly blackened like they had been burnt. Quite menacing. I seriously considered turning back, but my curiosity got the better of me. At that moment, I heard something in my head. It was hard to make out – muffled and very quiet. But it sounded like a warning. The words were inexplicable. I laughed nervously. How could someone, or something, talk inside my brain? I passed a small cabin on my left side. Having ventured into the unknown, it was comforting to see signs of human life, so I started making my way towards the cabin. It was a sorry sight. Wooden boards rotting away around the sides and vines and ivy covering up most of the front. It looked like nobody had been there for a very long time. I started to abandon any hope that there was anyone living here, but stepped closer. I heard the voice in my head again. It was still muffled, but now rushed and the threat was clear. I halted. This time a word was discernible – ‘Go!’ I don’t know why I didn’t stop. I was such an idiot. Ten paces. Five paces. I reached out for the rusted, copper handle, breathing quickly in anticipation, and as I touched it, my mind jolted and swayed like I had done something very wrong. There was the rushed voice again, but now inaudible. Seriously freaking out at this point, panic gripped me and I turned and ran. As I stumbled away, I could’ve sworn two small red dots appeared at the broken window of the shack, like glowing eyes. I couldn’t be sure but I didn’t stop to take a second look. As I approached the city, I couldn’t shake off the feeling I was being watched. I didn’t tell anyone about my experience in the wood when I got back to my apartment – not even my girlfriend. But I sure didn’t forget about it. Over the next few days, from dawn till dusk, I kept hearing the same muffled voice inside my head. I had nightmares about the cabin every night, about what may have been inside, about what I could have seen. Then, while typing up a report in the office, I found myself writing repeatedly: ‘You had a chance. You had a chance. You had a chance.’ Next thing I knew, I was in the hospital. Apparently, I had collapsed with convulsions. At one point, I had punched one of my friends in the nose, while delusional. I have to admit – I wasn’t taking the encounter in the wood very well. Then the doctor told me that during my seizure, I had murmured two words over and over again: ‘It’s coming.’ Shortly before I was discharged from hospital, I got the message that my boss was letting me off for a little while to get my problems sorted. This meant – ‘You’re fired.’ So now I’d lost my job to a stupid ghost story. Great. I was let out of the hospital around early evening, two days after my fit. Tired and hungry, I returned to my apartment, had a quick dinner then went straight to sleep. My girlfriend had gone out for the night to party with her friends, so I was alone. Or so it seemed. At two o’ clock, I jerked awake screaming. I switched the light on and calmed quickly, telling myself it was just another nightmare. Nevertheless, this one had been particularly real. I was back at the cabin in the woods – the door had opened, and the muffled voice had whispered - ‘You.’ Then the door had slammed shut, and a few moments later, a large body brushed against my shoulder and made its way towards the edge of the wood. It snarled like a wolf, and that’s when I awoke. Unable to sleep again, I made my way downstairs to the kitchen. I switched the radio on. Classical. Not really my style, but I was grateful to break the silence. I splashed my face with cold water at the sink a few times and looked at myself in the mirror mounted above it. I looked exhausted – I hadn’t really slept in days. Who could blame me? The music abruptly stopped. I flipped around, but there was no-one there. Had the radio fused? Next, the lights burned out above me, leaving me in complete darkness. Terrified, I heard the front door open and quickly close again. It didn’t sound as though anyone had entered, but I knew I wasn’t alone anymore. The lights flickered on again. I didn’t notice any change at first, but as I glanced in the mirror, I saw the picture on the wall behind me, the one of me and my girlfriend on our first date. My girlfriend’s striking blue eyes had been replaced with a malevolent red glow. Her beautiful, smiling face was twisted and contorted, her mouth a gaping, blacker than black hole. I turned, screaming, and nearly blacked out as I stared into the bloodcurdlingly deep, breathing mouth of a revolting, fetid spectre, hovering directly in front of me. It whispered one more time, but not in my head: ‘I warned you.’ The only thing I remember is the striking pain as it bit deep into my arm. Then the blackness mercifully claimed me. Woken by the blindingly bright sunlight of morning, paramedics were towering over me, fussing over my wounded arm. One of them dropped a sealed envelope on my lap, but didn’t say anything. I looked over at my arm and retched when I saw how bad it was. When I got my bearings again, I could see that I was lying on a stretcher in front of my apartment. My burning apartment. Firefighters were crowded around the sides of the building, spraying huge jets of water at all sides. The chances of moving back in looked pretty slim. The cause of the fire has never been agreed, but I know. I know. My kindly neighbour agreed to take me under her wing for a while, so at least I’d have a roof over my head. But I’d be alone. The envelope contained a letter from my beloved girlfriend. She was moving to New York. Thought it better if I was left alone for a while to recover from my ‘delusion’. This meant – ‘I’m dumping you.’ I cried for a while, then there seemed to be little point. A week later, I received news that strangely held no surprise. The doctor told me I had developed an aggressive cancer and it seemed to originate from the wound on my arm. They had never seen anything like it before – it was spreading at an incredible speed. They couldn’t do anything for me. It will gradually eat me away, and I knew I didn’t have much time left. That malodorous beast has taken my life. At least it has now left me in peace. As I walked back to my neighbour’s house, I saw the beggar from the start of my story, sitting in the same place across the road as before. He seemed to be in an even worse state. With tears in my eyes, I realise everything I own has been destroyed. I was no better than this vagabond who had cursed me. I swallow back the emotion and turn to glance at the beggar again, then did what I thought was right. Walking over, I emptied my pockets of the remainder of my money. My last possessions. He looked up and grinned at me. For a second, I swear I saw a flash of red glow within his eyes, then dirty brown twinkles once again. “Thanks,” he said as he took the money. Again, a brief red flash. My imagination, nothing more. But I couldn’t be sure."}

You would expect this sort of thing out of an utterly dysfunctional country like China, but as it turns out we have plenty of morons right here in the US to approve such a thing. I remember shaking my head in disbelief at the magazine article when I first learned of the project. “Chicago to Get Artificial Mountain In 2028”. I stared at the hideous CG-rendering and read the blurb: “Officials say mountain will bring tourism, jobs, and habitat for wildlife.” It was not April 1st, and this was not a satire publication. Some no-name architect from Russia (or was it France?) had actually gotten not only approval but a hefty sum of taxpayer funding to building this monstrosity of his fantasies. In a city like Chicago you can hardly build a gas station without having to jump through a hundred miles of hoops and red tape, yet this guy got virtually a blank check from the city, state, and federal government to build his loathsome “public art” project. The grants had already been made, which meant this thing was past the point of just being one of those ideas you read about sometimes that look cool to some people but you know will never come anywhere close to fruition, like a space elevator in Popular Science or a proposal to build a skyscraper out of living material or whatever. This guy had actually come in and said, “Hey, I noticed your city doesn’t have any mountains. I can fix that,” and was taken seriously. You would think there would have been a public outcry over the government’s intention to use untold billions of taxpayer dollars to build the world’s biggest eyesore since Mount Rushmore in the middle of a city that already had plenty in the way of architecture and tourist attractions. One of my first thoughts was that this had to be some kind of test. The governments of Cook County, Illinois, and the United States, having gotten away with so much shit over the decades, finally just conspired to see what it would take for the public to come at them with literal torches and pitchforks by doing the stupidest thing imaginable, making them pay for it, and having it be something that many of them would be reminded of constantly because they had to drive past the result every day on the way to work. Alas, there was no great public outcry, at least not at first. Many people just didn’t believe it was going to happen initially. I talked to one guy at a bar who said he would never believe in “the mountain” until construction actually started. Then construction started, albeit five years behind schedule, and people started getting concerned. The first thing they did was take the poorest, most crime-ridden neighborhood they could find and put it under eminent domain. Like that old computer game SimCity, they just displaced a few thousand residents so they could plop a fake mountain there. And yet, even as Chicago started to become a national laughing stock, the mountain project actually had ardent defenders. People would write letters to the editor in the leading Chicago newspapers saying the project had been needed for years. Politicians, far from shying away and hoping people would forget they had anything to do with the project being approved, touted how the mountain could be used for scientific purposes in a way that natural mountains could not (let that bit of genius logic sink in for a bit). Some talking head on TV said the mountain would finally be the thing to put Chicago in the same tier of global cities as New York and London. And eventually, I started hearing stories that other cities in the US and around the world were thinking about installing their own mountains. They never did though, because the project panned out exactly as I had predicted it would. They got a little over halfway done, before the money ran out, and to everyone’s complete shock and surprise (sarcasm) no one who was supposed to know the answers seemed to know where the rest of the money went. They spent a bunch of weeks passing the buck in circles while the EPA started investigating the giant pile of limestone and concrete with a gaping hole in the top as an environmental hazard that they somehow hadn’t thought it would be before the building began. The architect and a couple other project leaders up and disappeared, no doubt fearing prosecution and litigation for something. I felt no small amount of schadenfreude when heads finally, finally started to roll. Not content to simply watch politicians and bureaucrats face Congressional hearings, I used the massive failure vindictively against anyone I knew who had been on the side of those who insisted that the mountain was a good idea and had attacked and slandered people like me who saw it for what it was. One of my two sisters-in-law, who liked to pick political fights at extended family gatherings in that smug “I’m just making conversation, sorry if you can’t see it my way” kind of way, had once told me I was behind the times and that if I didn’t want to help boost the local economy and help the environment with the mountain I should just move to “Mississippi or some other place where people are more in line with your thinking”. Boy did I have fun rubbing her nose in it when the shit hit the fan. And I didn’t do it in an upfront way that she could easily dodge or defend against. Instead, I would needle her with it in subtle, passive-aggressive ways whenever she would start to get a chip. Like at Thanksgiving, when she started shaming my uncle for being too apathetic about charity in her view, I made a casual comment, not to her but to the table, about how I wondered if anyone had ever heard from the mountain architect since he disappeared. I got a few chuckles, and that was enough to make her squirm and shut her up. A few more times of using the boon to subtly troll her, and she eventually stopped bringing up politics at holidays altogether, something my family is probably grateful to me for. But having some vindictive fun at my sister-in-law’s expense didn’t help the fact that we were now all stuck with a half-finished monument no one wanted, or had any idea what to do with. The project didn’t have any champions left, so it was never going to be finished, but at the same time cleaning it all up would be at least as troublesome and expensive at this point, not to mention the fact that a new big project would have to be agreed upon to take the mountain’s place, since the government wasn’t going to just give all the poor people their houses back. This dilemma was momentarily resolved when the mountain unexpectedly became a valuable research site. While rumors were going around that Disney had plans to buy Mount Appelgate (the official name was Mount Sable, but a state politician who had opposed the mountain had brilliantly called it Mount Appelgate after his election rival, who had made the mistake of not retracting his early tentative support for the mountain once it became clear that the mountain was a mistake; even though he never even voted for the project, the name stuck, and it was enough to doom his political career) and turn it into a ski resort, these weird birds flew in from nowhere. From February through March, an unknown bird species migrated in droves, often at night and during storms. They arrived in the thousands, stopping at Mount Appelgate, driving off the seagulls who had started to roost there, and forming a colony. Naturalists captured some and determined them to be in the swallow taxon. They were similar to cliff swallows, but larger and with much more black coloration. One naturalist claimed that they were from somewhere in South America based on dubious bacteria tests, but no other scientists came out in support of this theory. Like cliff swallows, they built their colony by making clay, mixing dirt with their own saliva. But they made their clay at a much higher efficiency than cliff swallows. They would scour the city at night, collecting suitable dirt as fast as they could and bringing it back to the mountain. Eventually, scientists realized they were making far more clay than was necessary to build their nests. They came to a conclusion that shocked everyone. Looking back, I think the scariest and most unsettling part about this whole thing was watching scientists on TV desperately beating around the bush when it came to the conclusion they had come to, trying to avoid being the first one to say it out loud but wanting everyone to get the gist. They had concluded that the oversized nocturnal swallows were attempting to finish the mountain. Whether that was the case or not, they never did it, because Mount Appelgate collapsed a few months later. Long fissures had been showing up, so people knew it was going to happen, and thus there was plenty of footage. The collapse was surprisingly quiet, but caused a mild tremor that could be felt for a split-second around much of the city. It also left a cloud of dust and debris that lingered for more than an hour. At this point, there were serious proposals to just make it official and turn the site into a literal landfill. But first, naturalists wanted to dig through some of the rubble to see if they could find any dead specimens of the swallows (the flock had been seen flying away minutes before the collapse and were never found again). They found specimens, but not the kind they were looking for. The specimens they found were fossils. As in, classic bone-in-stone fossils. They found thousands of them embedded in some of the limestone that had been used to build the mountain. None of the workers who had constructed the project had any idea how they got there.

Much of this I don’t remember, for obvious reasons, but over the years I’ve spoken with my mother and other family members about everything, and I’ve written their accounts down as accurately as anyone could. Apart from that, I’ve gotten copies of all the police reports, and have written this using information gleaned from them. It all started, quite literally, the day I was born. I was in the nursery of the hospital, and my mom and grandparents were standing at the window. Being that I was born at a large hospital in a major city, there were seven or eight other babies there beside me. Next to my family, another woman was standing with a big smile on her face, not a creepy one, but the smile of someone who was genuinely happy at that particular moment. She was an average looking woman of maybe about 22, and had stringy blonde hair. My grandma said she looked like she hadn’t showered in days. Regardless of her disheveled appearance, my grandmother greeted the woman. The woman replied cheerily, commenting that all the babies were so adorable. My mom asked the woman which baby belonged to her, but the woman gave her an awkward kind of half-glance and didn’t answer her. My mom just assumed the woman hadn’t heard her. They all continued observing me and the other babies, with my family making comments about how big of a baby I was. They eventually realized the woman was humming. The blonde lady eventually became aware herself that my family was hearing her, and she quickly apologized, explaining that she was just so excited that her “ baby boy was finally here ”. Now that they were interacting again, my mom posed the same question she had earlier, asking the woman which child was hers. The woman replied slowly, in a sing-songy voice, “ My…baby…boy…issssss…right there! ” She finished the statement off with a burst of energy and pressed her fingers against the glass. “ Isn’t he beautiful? I just love him so much. ” My mom and grandparents tried to determine which baby she was pointing at. “ The one there, with the white blanket? ” my grandpa asked her. “ Noooo! That baby isn’t even half as cute as my baby boy! ” The woman was still talking in a playful, sing-songy kind of voice, if that makes sense. She didn’t seem threatening, or creepy, she just seemed like an especially affable new mother. She kept her finger pressed to the window and brought her face up to it so her nose was just touching the glass. “ That’s my sweet, beautiful, amazing little baby boy, right…there! ” She still hadn’t given any other clues as to which baby she was pointing at, and it wasn’t immediately evident because the handful of babies were all mostly grouped together. “ Is he…right there? ” my grandpa took another guess, pressing his own finger to the window. “ With the Nike hat? ” The woman took a deep breath. She started giddily stamping her feet as if she were overcome with joy. She took her finger from the glass and started clapping her hands together. “ He’s so perfect!!! Isn’t he?! Isn’t he perfect?! ” My grandfather looked at my grandma and nodded his head once, and she took it to mean that she should go find a hospital employee. After she walked away, my grandpa turned back to the woman, who was still staring at the baby in the Nike hat, a look of pure joy on her face. The baby in the Nike hat was me. “ Ma’am… ” my grandpa said to her, but she didn’t reply. When my grandpa told me the story (this part of which I’ve also heard from my mom separately, nearly verbatim), he said that when they realized she was all effusive over me, a newborn that wasn’t hers and didn’t have any relation to her, the woman didn’t seem delusional or confused, nor did she seem threatening or dangerous. She just seemed like a new mom, albeit an over-excited one. “ Ma’am, ” he said again. This time, the woman whipped her head around and the look of joy on her face was gone. “ What? ” she said through clenched teeth. “ He’s mine. And he’s beautiful. You don’t think he’s beautiful? ” My grandpa looked at her and simply said, “ I don’t think he’s yours. “ The woman started breathing heavily, and my mom has described her as looking angrier than she’s ever seen anyone before or since. My grandpa put his arm in front of my mom and guided her backward and behind him, making sure he was between her and the woman. Then, as quickly as she’d flipped from excited to enraged, she calmed down and a warm smile crawled across her face. She kissed the tips of her fingers and pressed them to the glass once again. And with that, she turned around and walked away. Like 30 seconds after the woman left my grandma came back with a doctor, to whom my mom and grandpa explained what had just happened. The doctor apologized profusely, explaining that, for obvious reasons, they were very strict about who could get into the nursery, and that he had no idea how someone would get in there without authorization. A security guard was placed in the nursery until (and presumably after) I was taken home. Now to where I can (however vaguely) recall for myself. My mom and I went to a playground in the springtime when I was six years old, and had walked there since the weather was nice. After I’d played on the playground for a while and tired myself out, we began to head back home. About halfway between the playground and our house, two police cars pulled to a screeching halt. Two cops got out of the first car, and one out of the second, all with gun drawn. They yelled at my mom to get on the ground, and because I didn’t know what was going on, after she did, I got on my stomach on top of her back, begging them not to hurt her. My mom was placed in handcuffs and put into the back of the second cop car while the police talked to me. I explained that the woman they’d detained was indeed my mother, and I assured them of that even after they asked me about twenty times. After more police showed up and talked to me, as well as my mom, we learned that a frantic woman had placed an anonymous call to police claiming that a woman with the exact description of my mother and her outfit that day had abducted “her son”, who had the exact description of me and what I was wearing that day. The call had been placed from a payphone outside the convenience store a few blocks from our house, and the police, after assuming the woman who called had hung up before identifying herself had done so in the heat of the moment, put out an Amber Alert. When the police had finally determined that I was indeed my mother’s son, they apologized and dropped us back off at our house. Around that time I’d noticed my grandparents and mom getting into heated discussions, not necessarily arguments but just more vocally distressed. Specifically on the day that the fake kidnapping was reported, I remember hearing “ it was her, you know it was her ”, and other similar things. I wasn’t sure exactly what they were talking about, but they assured me everything was okay. The following year, when I was in second grade, one of the office workers came to my classroom and asked the teacher to excuse me. When I left the room, I was escorted with the office worker and two other school employees to the office, where I was sat in the conference room. I remember sitting there for about a half hour with the woman who’d gotten me from my classroom, but she wouldn’t tell me what was going on. The door to the conference room had a glass pane from nearly top to bottom, so while I waited I watched as two police officers came in and talked to the other office employees. Eventually, my mom walked in, and a few minutes after her arrived my grandparents. All three of them rushed in by me and began giving me hugs and asking if I was okay. Then, my mom, my grandparents, the two police officers, two of the three office employees, and the school principal came in and asked me if I’d been approached by anyone I didn’t know recently, to which I responded that I hadn’t. They told me, in no uncertain terms, that if anyone I didn’t know ever came up to me, to begin running and screaming for help until I get to somewhere safe. Apparently, as I learned years later, a woman had come in to the school claiming to be my aunt, and demanded that I be released into her care, as there was a family emergency and my mom and grandparents were unable to get me from school. Due to protocol, the office workers obviously did not comply with what the woman was demanding. When one of the workers said they would call my home to get permission to release me (a ruse of course, she was going to and did call the police), the woman responded by saying, “ That beautiful baby boy only has me. He only has me and you’re trying to keep him from me. I don’t know what that beautiful child ever did to you to deserve such horrible treatment. All he wants is me, and you’re keeping him from me. He’s such a beautiful perfect baby boy and you want to hurt him! Shame on you! ” and hurried out of the school with tears running down her face. After the incident at the school, I wasn’t allowed to walk home alone, and I was asked regularly if I was approached by any strangers, to which I could honestly say I hadn’t been. About a year after that, we began getting phone calls. They were your typical creepy calls, with someone just breathing on the other end of the line then hanging up. Some days we’d get thirty calls, others we’d get only one. Eventually, my grandpa had our number changed, but that only quelled the issue for about two weeks before the calls began again. The day after my 13th birthday, my mom and grandparents sat me down and said they had to tell me something. They explained that every year on my birthday, I would receive a card in the mail, it would come with no return address, but as the years went on, the messages inside the birthday cards became increasingly bizarre. By that point, my family felt that I was mature enough to know, and that I had a right to read the letters, which they had copied before they were given to the police. I won’t regale the letters in their entirety, but here are some highlights: The very first letter, from my first birthday, was just a generic birthday card with the message “ To the most beautiful baby boy in the entire world. Love, your real mommy. ” By the time I was six, they’d gotten a bit more direct. “ My beautiful, perfect baby boy, I miss you and I love you so much, and I am so, SO angry that they’re keeping you away from me. I love you more than life itself, sweetheart. You are mine. ” I opened the letter I’d gotten the day prior, on my 13th birthday. Another basic birthday card, but by this point the messages were overtly threatening. “ Have a wonderful birthday, my beautiful, perfect, amazing baby boy. They will regret keeping us apart. I know you want to be with me and I know I need to be with you. We are supposed to be together, I’m your REAL mother. I love you. I love you way more than the fakes you live with now. They will regret ever stealing you from me. ” That letter too was taken to the police, but as per usual there wasn’t much to be done. Around the time I turned 15 is when things got exponentially creepier. Police and emergency services were called to an apartment building in a very undesirable part of the town in which I live in relation to a tenant having had a heart attack. After they’d done their duties, a different tenant from another floor of the building asked one of the police officers to check on an apartment unit at the end of the hall, because there were awful smells coming from inside. The tenant said they’d complained to the landlord numerous times but nothing had been done as the landlord was largely indifferent to the goings-on of the building. The officer went to the other floor and noted the smell, and knocked on the door of the one bedroom unit at the end of the hall. The tenant who had brought the smell to the officer’s attention said she’d never actually seen anyone going into or coming out of the unit, and therefore didn’t know if it was a male or female, a single person or a family, or if there were any pets. Deciding the smell was a potential indicator of an issue, the officer forcibly entered the apartment. I remember him telling me that he would’ve bet his own life that he was going to find a dead body in the apartment, but he didn’t. Upon entering, he found piles of rotten food and other garbage everywhere. The smell seemed to have come from the multiple glasses of spoiled milk and half-eaten plates of eggs, moldy bread and rotten fruit, as well as any number of other pieces of trash that was strewn about the apartment. But that wasn’t nearly the most noteworthy thing about the apartment. What stood out the most was the pictures, the hundreds upon hundreds of pictures that were tacked, taped, and/or stapled to the wall. I’ve seen photos taken of the scene, and it truly must have been a sight to behold in person. The pictures, which were from both traditional film as well as Polaroid cameras, covered every wall in the apartment, in every room. Both sides of cabinet doors, both sides of closet and bedroom doors, even the ceilings throughout the unit were all covered in the pictures. The officer cleared the apartment, and once he knew he was alone, he looked around more closely. In the closet of the bedroom, a pile standing nearly to the overhead shelf, as well as piled on the shelf itself, were notebooks. The notebooks were filled front and back, cover to cover, with what were essentially ramblings about a “ beautiful baby boy ” and how he was “ going to be reunited ” with the author someday. They eventually devolved into blatant threats such as “ Everyone who keeps us apart will die. No one will be spared. We will show all of them, all of them who don’t understand us, and we will make them hurt the way they hurt us. ” Investigators spent days removing and logging all of the photos off the walls and ceilings, and even longer transcribing all of the notebooks, which, based on infrequent labellings of dates went back to 1989. June 8th, 1989 specifically. My birthday. They spoke to the landlord, who said he had never actually met the tenant that lived in the apartment at the end of the hall. The tenant had been living there for some time when he bought the building, and he received rent on time, so he saw no point in disturbing them. Original documents with the name and information of the tenant were destroyed in flooding after having been haphazardly kept in a storage unit in the basement of the building, and because the landlord got his rent money on time, he never bothered to have them fill out new copies. Whilst trying to determine the identity of the tenant, they also worked on identifying the subject of the notebooks and pictures. They were able to put the pictures into a rough sequential order, and found that the main subject of the pictures has been so since birth. The tenant of the apartment had been taking pictures of me from afar since I was brought home from the hospital. Pictures of me playing with my mom and grandparents, playing at school, my yearbook pictures (which was how they eventually identified me, by going to all the schools in the area and eventually finding my middle school, where my sixth grade yearbook photo was recognized), pictures of me sleeping taken through my bedroom window, and all other manner of secretive photos taken of me at any and all junctures of my life. We were notified, and my mom and grandparents went over the previous incidents that had occurred over the years, but were still no closer to finding out who the woman was. After the apartment was discovered, years went by, and it wasn’t until I was 19 that anything else happened. I was at my girlfriend’s house, and we decided to go out for something to eat. Her car was parked in the driveway, and when we went outside, we found that all four of her tires had been gouged open. On the passenger’s side of the car was a message, keyed deeper than I’ve ever seen any scratches on a car. STAY AWAY HES MY BABY BOY WHORE The police were called, but they didn’t really have much to go on. My girlfriend and I weren’t very deep into the relationship, and the incident had understandably freaked her out, so for her safety and peace of mind, we decided to break up. Not long after we broke up, I received a letter in the mail. “ Thank you for getting rid of that nasty girl. You know I’m the only woman you need in your life, and that your REAL mother knows best. Now all you have to do is get rid of your fake mom and fake grandma and fake grandpa. I’m your REAL family. Your REAL mom. And you’re my REAL baby boy. Nothing will ever change that. I can’t wait until you come back to me. ” It was taken to the police all that, but of course, nothing was done. The following year, in the middle of the night, our home security system went off. We got up to see what was going on, and the police showed up very soon after. At our back door, they found evidence of someone tampering with the lock, and in our neighbor’s backyard, where footsteps had led, a butcher knife. On the side of our house was written “ FAKES ” in red paint. We decided to move after that incident, and nothing else happened until my 21st birthday. A six-year-old boy was kidnapped on the morning of June 8th, 2010. Around 11pm, reports of two bodies were called in, an adult female and a male child that was immediately identified as the missing boy. The location of the bodies was the backyard of the house we’d moved from about six months prior, and was called in by the husband of the couple that moved in after we left. Along with the bodies was an envelope with one picture from each year of my life up to that point and a letter. Police concluded that the woman had strangled the six-year-old to death and cut her own wrists, bleeding out in the backyard I’d grown up playing in. The letter stated “ This ugly little boy doesn’t even begin to compare to my beautiful baby. But he was close enough. They wouldn’t let me have my baby, and they made me hurt this one. When they moved they took my baby away from me for good. I looked but I couldn’t find them. The fakes. They are fakes and they stole the most beautiful, precious boy this world will ever have. I hope they’re happy. Happy they killed this ugly little boy. I give up. The world is a terrible place, keeping a mother from her boy. And nobody ever tried to help me get him back. I will see them all in hell. ” The boy she’d killed had brown hair and brown eyes like me, and police believed she cut his hair to match the photo of six-year-old me, and also dressed him in the same clothes I’d been wearing in the picture, which they believe she’d stolen from my house years and years earlier. The woman herself was a transient with no legitimate work history to speak of, and in the subsequent investigation, was found to be a prostitute and methamphetamine addict. My mom and grandparents, as well as the office workers present during the incident when I was in second grade, were shown photos of the woman, and said that there was a chance she was the woman they’d seen in the hospital and school, respectively, decades earlier, and accepted that the ravages of time and drug addiction could have altered her appearance considerably. With this, we thought everything had met its end, albeit a gruesomely tragic one. I’m 28-years-old now, my mom and grandparents are living happy lives, as am I. I’m married, and have a great career. All of this crossed my mind from time to time, but for the most part I’d put it behind me. That is, until I received a letter in the mail last week. “ I tried accepting that the world would never let us be together. That they wanted you to stay with your fake family, and now with your whore. But I know thats not true, baby. You’re my beautiful, perfect baby boy, and I know you better than anyone knows you, and I know you need to be with me. I see you every day living your fake life and I know it’s not what you really want. I know your whole life you’ve been told that those fakes are your family, and that they are who you should love, but they are WRONG. I am who you need to love. You are MY BOY. We will be together. No matter what. I promise. I promise I will never let you go. I love you. ” I took the letter to the police, but as always, there’s only so much they can do. Since I learned what was going on, that I was being stalked, I’ve often wondered why I was chosen by this woman to be the object of her bizarre affection. What I do know is that I need to protect my mom, grandma, grandpa, and wife. I’ve been pursued by this woman since moments after I came into this world. I don’t think I’ll ever know why.

He dreaded going home this early in the morning because he would occasionally find his wife's car to be missing. She never mentioned leaving in the night, and never called to warn him. She often left the kids alone in this manner. The last time that this happened, Gregory waited. He wanted to know the truth without seeming too suspicious, but his efforts fell in vain. The 12-hour shift had taken it's toll and left him completely drained. Fatigue had taken over... The children returned from school at about three in the afternoon to end Gregory's deep slumber. He did not need an alarm for they were slamming doors and screaming at one another—as children often do. He cursed the sun, his life, and everything around him as he slowly shut the blinds. He decided to take a shower, as it would grant him a little more time to himself. He tried not to think of his spouse's late night departures, but his mind was too stubborn and refused to leave it be. And even though he was in a steaming hot shower, his skin crawled in a chilled suspicion. His surroundings fell and he was left in a sullen world of nonexistence. Nothing moved and silence spoke. His eyes were fleeting dreams. Indecision had become him. Should I confront her? Will this ruin our marriage? What about the kids? His thoughts ran around that simple track for what seemed like innumerable days when his mind suddenly returned. A child's scream, preceded by the sound of shattering glass, traveled through the walls and pierced him in his confused state. He quickly shut off the now freezing water, threw on his robe and rushed down the stairs. Once down the steps, a strange friction in the air began to oppress him. He felt a needy warmth in his throat and started to gasp for air. Where are you? was the new thought, ever circulating through his mind. He wanted to shout the question in search for a reply, but his vocal strength had failed him. He tumbled onto the floor of the kitchen, landing in a large glass-filled puddle of blood. Intense light beams shone about the house, casting their light upon Gregory's innocent face. The world had turned to shadows right outside his window, and now just light remained... It engulfed him. It swallowed all of his desires and fulfilled all his basic needs. Nonexistence had returned. When woken from the light, Gregory realized that he couldn't move. On a surgery table of some sort, he was held tightly in place by a series of metal bars. Round in diameter, they ran through the table to be locked at the bottom. All was dark again. Gregory let out a narrow scream, but found it to be hollow. His lungs were weak and his heart beat slowly. Something flickered behind him. It sounded like someone typing on a typewriter, but had a distinct flowing quality to it. Suddenly, an image was projected before him onto a massive screen. A photograph of his family was the first image he saw. His wife and two kids smiling, but he wasn't there. Another man stood in his place and held his daughter, yet they all appeared to be one big happy family. What's happening? and Where am I? kept crawling through his head as the pictures flashed. This can't be true. That's my family! He could not comprehend the meaning of it all. Every moment in Gregory's life was being repeated by this dashing young man, and these photographs were hard evidence that supported it. Has my whole life been a lie? The questions continued to rise as his head spun it's usual webs. The picture reel ended and with it the momentary sight. He was once more in darkness. A shuffle of feet could be heard in the room. They were distant echoes, but they cut the silence. Louder and louder, the constant beat controlled his unsteady heartbeat. The energy was stirring; climbing upon his shoulders until, finally, the footsteps reached him. About five feet to his right, the stranger came to stop. His breathing grew to a constant in-out tempo. Gregory heard a muffled thump and fluorescent lights came on—what he saw disturbed him: A pile of organs lay rotting on the floor. Maggots crawled through the mass of tissue in a lofty manner. They were having a feast. And even though Gregory vowed no religion, he began to pray. To whatever God was up there he begged forgiveness. And it was while he was mumbling to himself in religious ignorance that he felt a slight graze on the back of his neck. The room was dark again. He heard a door just in front of him open, and what sounded like a cage was rolled in. After a brief clashing of some keys, the cage was opened and a hissing sound could be heard. Not too long after, something long and smooth wrapped around Gregory's legs. His entire lower body began to fall asleep. As they began to wrap around his midsection, He become one with their constrictions. His body had lost all sense of touch and identity. The snakes did not seem to notice the progressive thickening of the air. The room began to smell like smoke. The next half hour remained this way, as the air slowly grew heavier, until a faint red glow appeared in the open doorway ahead of him, slightly illuminating the putrid organs as their flesh began to fester. The flames were now visible directly ahead of him. He saw the stranger clearly now as he ran to avoid the fire. He held under each of his arms both of Gregory's children, each one heavily sedated. The stranger wore no cloth, but only skin. Human skin. To be more specific: Gregory's wife . The stranger wore Gregory's wife as a hide over his own naked body. He arranged the bodies of Greg's children on tables adjacent to his own, all while the snakes still had their grip. He was growing more pale as the tragedy unfolded. He would have puked too, had the snakes not begun to coil around his throat. This was it... In a few minutes it would all be over. He stopped praying at this point, for God showed no sympathy. The fires grew as the madman began skinning the children. He seemed to take delight in it. The stranger whistled 'Amazing Grace' as he scalped Greg's oldest son. He worked his way down the body, stitching any possible mistakes in the formation of his new coat of skin. When he finally finished, he called the snakes back into their cage. He left the room once more, but this time he did not return. At least not for a while. The flames worked their way into the room as Gregory's youngest daughter regained consciousness. He wanted to speak but could only watch. She began coughing, lost in the wild heat, and started to cry after seeing her pale, tortured father. The flames were just behind her. She felt their white warmth lap against the back of her head. Gregory shut his eyes. He wanted it to end. All he could smell was burning hair as she screamed in agony. His eyes were tightly shut. He did not want any mental photographs to take home, should he survive. Her violent screeching continued for no more than ten minutes, progressively receding to a whimper, when the flames had reached his table. He thought his fate was sealed when something strange happened: w ater. A shower poured down onto Gregory's face from a sprinkler system in the roof. Why had it taken so long to turn on? Perhaps it was manually controlled? He opened his eyes and in the split second before the lights were shut off, he saw a steaming heap of cooked flesh and charred bones where his daughter used to be. He could not cry, his blood was barely flowing. In the darkness again, he now heard voices. Multiple voices, speaking in a language he could not understand. They were far away, possibly behind a wall, and their speech filled the boundless all. Nothing remained but that foul stench. It was hard to believe that this was real. Just days before, he had taken his family out to dinner at a fine restaurant, but now they were all dead; mutilated. The lights came back on. \"Oh, what could possibly happen now? Are you gonna kill me?\" he had finally found the strength to speak. A hidden door was then opened to his right. Men filed out of the secret opening. They seemed like men at least. They all wore lab coats and seemed to be arguing in their mysterious language. They crowded around Gregory as one worked a lever across the room. His table was slowly being raised upright. It was already raised at a slight angle though, so this ascension was brief. The men continued to speak whilst observing Gregory. One man pointed to the center of his chest and they all seemed to agree with him something. Gregory grew nervous. His heart began to beat faster. A tall man in the group walked over to the hidden doorway and shouted something inside, then resumed his position in the group. The men then fell to silence. Moments later a woman entered the room. She held a syringe filled with some clear, bubbly liquid. She put the needle to Gregory's heart and pushed. Birds could be heard whistling their favorite tunes as Gregory opened his eyes. Wrapped in clean, warm covers, he welcomed the sound and opened his eyes to the bursting light. The sounds of nature were full & glorious, yet something seemed to be missing. He felt reborn in those first few moments when he realized he was still alive, but now a terrible emptiness filled his mind. He ran about the house checking all the rooms, but found not one living thing. His thoughts once again filled the boundless all. What's happening? he asked himself but found no reply. He stepped out the front door as it began to rain and all was dark once more."}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Month_of_Rain", "title": "Untitled", "author": "woods", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Disappearances", "Cryptids"], "content": "So just a couple of minutes ago, I came across a thread in the forums asking the reader if they’ve had any paranormal or creepy things happen to them. Well, it got me thinking about this one time I was evacuated from my childhood town. I must’ve been about seven at the time, and I can somewhat remember the event clearly even if most of it is pretty hard to recall. Since all you guys are looking for a good spook, I’ll give it a shot and tell the tale. So in my childhood town, I had a good friend named Finny. Finny and I were really close, almost like brothers. I was an only child growing up, and I hung out with Finny almost every day if memory serves. My childhood memories were so precious, and the town itself was so peaceful and benevolent. The town was surrounded by woods, and it even had its own police station and town hall. Everything was picture perfect. Everything was fine until there was a month of rain. When I say a month of rain, I literally mean it; it would never stop raining. It rained that whole month nonstop, and it was kind of strange since the rain came in unannounced by meteorologists. It was almost similar to that of a hurricane, with strong winds, thunder, lightning, and lengthy periods of rain. It almost came out of nowhere, it just started pouring. The sky went dim and gloomy, the clouds rolled in, the rain fell and it continued for as long as I could remember. Eventually the ponds, canals, and rivers would start rising due to the heavy rain. The flooding all took place within the first two weeks. I remember this one night, when it was thundering; I was looking outside my window. I noticed that the lighting had strange colors. Some would look orange, others would look green, and some even purple. This made the rain fall even harder. Eventually the waters had gotten so high, that it reached up to our ankles. We would still go to school since they thought the floods weren’t too big a deal. They made us wear raincoats, boots, and also made us take umbrellas with us every day. We all took notice that there was an outbreak of insomnia among us children at the time ever since the rain arrived. I found it hard to sleep as well, and it was one of the many reasons I looked at the lightning at night. We all felt so drawn to the rain, and found it strangely soothing and calming. The lights continued in the sky every night until eventually there was the loudest thunder strike. At least, I thought it was. I bet it woke the whole town up. It struck somewhere within the woods, and then things got weird. Every night, we’d hear weird noises, voices, whispers, and scratching outside. Sinkholes or burrows could be found all over patios, lawns, gardens, and the woods. The water rose up to our waists, and eventually school was called off on occasion. My friend Finny and some other kids in our clique would visit my house often to play; sometimes, they might even stay the night. I remember this one time, waking up one night and being drawn to the window. We were in our living room, and my other friend Bryce was looking outside the window I felt enticed to look out of when I awoke. He and two other kids were at the window looking outside as if intrigued. They said that someone was calling out to them and inviting them out to play inside the rain. We looked outside and saw nothing. A few minutes passed as we continued to look out the window, feeling strangely enticed to go outside. Eventually, the rain hit harder, and it also appeared that something was swimming in my flooded back yard. It never emerged from the water to show us its identity, or what it was. We just assumed it was the rain making weird patterns in the water as it hit it. The urge to go outside remained, and we began hearing whispers again. They usually ranged from “Come outside, it is safe,” or “Come play with us.” Most of what someone would say to convince a child to come out of a hiding spot. My dad came home, and we pretended to sleep since it was way past our bedtimes. My dad was a police officer and was working hard lately, but my friends and I did not know why. I remember my dad walking in and speaking to my mother. He said that kids were disappearing one by one, they’ve had no luck catching the kidnapper, and that the abductions were taking place much more frequently. It was true. Walter, Lee, Jennifer, and many others didn’t show up at school, or any type of meeting place we would visit. I remember his face being so discouraged and worried, almost sickened. I remember my mom and dad’s conversation, as my friends and I lied awake listening to every detail. “We couldn’t find a single trace. Some were even taken from home, and there were no signs of forced entry…” he said, and my mother sat next to him trying to comfort him. Other conversations went on, but nothing to relevant to what was happening at the time, and they eventually went to bed. However, before they did, they made sure to lock all doors and close all curtains. My friends and I stayed up talking about what we’d just heard, and made up our own little Ideas on what was happening, but all too childish. From time to time, the whispers would return and wake us up. Sometimes it was even scratching or clawing at the walls or windows. We wouldn’t dare to open the curtains and see what it was for ourselves. Who could blame us? I mean, there was a madman that kidnapped children on the loose. These events went on for weeks, and the kidnappings only got worse. Houses were found empty in the morning, and sometimes some kids would be left behind, too traumatized to speak and alone in the house with “again” no signs of forced entry. The town was mortified, and eventually a town meeting was called. Some of my friends were missing too, and all that was left of my clique was Finny and Dalton. We waited outside the courthouse with my mom as it went on. I remember asking about what they were talking about, but my mother would always avoid telling me usually by saying “Some very boring stuff grown-ups talk about dear,” or “You’re too young, you wouldn’t understand. Plus you’d probably fall asleep, it’s pretty long honey.” I remember the night before the evacuation, exactly one day before the month finished. I live next door to Dalton, and it was the night I saw them leave. The lights didn’t even go on; they sort of just went out of the house, leaving everything behind. They didn’t bother to lock the door, they didn’t bother to pack, and they didn’t bother to change clothing. They left their front door, and they walked into the woods. I was assuming they were taking a shortcut, but I still found it pretty strange. It was drizzling a bit as they left, and the rain was beginning to die down. I started hearing whispers again, only much louder. I looked out of my window and looked at the flooded streets. I saw strange patterns in the water again, and as if it was trailing a moving object under the water. I remembered that there was a crazy person stealing children at night, and decided to close my curtains so that no one could see into my room. Then the clawing and scratching began. The whispers and scratching never left, and I was surprised I even fell asleep. I was woken up by my mother, and the sound of the emergency evacuation alarm that the town hall had set off. I was too groggy to panic, and I just followed my mom outside. We were going through our escape route that went through higher terrain within the woods, and we took a dirt road. As we plodded through the water, we met with Finny and his mother. They both talked for a while as we paused awaiting others to join us. My father and a couple of his squad came through the road bearing shotguns and flashlights. My mother asked him what he was doing, and my father only replied “We found the place they were keeping the children” in the grimmest of expressions I’ve ever seen. My mother kissed him goodbye and wished him and his squad good luck as they trudged through the murky, muddy waters and into the deep woods. My mom motioned for me to come with her, but suddenly another woman came asking for help. My mom told me and Finny to stay put as she left with Finny’s mother to assist the woman. We did as we were told, and stood in the muddy and murky waters. We began to hear faint whispers again, and felt soothingly relaxed. The feeling was ominous, and it persisted for the duration that we spent waiting for our mothers to return. I remember tripping into the water, or so I thought, until I couldn’t seem to stand up. I panicked when I felt a force pulling me into the water, and as I heard Finny’s panicked screams. I felt a hand grab tightly onto my shoulder, and pull me to the surface. My mother carried me and placed me onto a nearby fence and checked on me. I thought I probably tripped into a sinkhole or a deep area of the trail since there were many holes around here. I noticed Finny’s mother calling out his name and searching everywhere for him. I didn’t realize that Finny had fallen in with me too. I continued thinking it was a sinkhole we slipped into, and that’s what I told Finny’s mother and my mom. That is, until I felt a throbbing pain and bruise on my ankle. Upon inspecting it, we found that a skinny, bony hand print was left on it. Another loud clash of lighting occurred, and it began to rain again. We eventually reached high ground, and we got into the buses and cars that waited for us. Many of the cars there were loved ones and family that came to pick up the townspeople that evacuated. We found that my uncle was waiting for us, and we got in his car. I didn’t see my dad, or Finny at the evacuation area. Come to think of it, I never saw my dad or his squad again. They were announced missing, and to this day I’m still not sure what happened to them or Finny along with all the other children. I am certain of one thing: there was something in the water.

At first she kept him to the study", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Historical Archive", "Weird"], "content": "When Anita found him, her immediate reaction was to put him in the foyer next to the stairwell so he could be decorative. Not everyone would have one, and the way his arms stuck out just so would make him a suitable hat rack. She realized, almost too late, that this might have been in bad taste. But what, she thought, was a woman supposed to do when her husband went and turned into a glass statue overnight? She had heard of this happening, of course. It just seemed to happen to other people; one day they were perfectly normal and then the next, someone found them frozen. Clear. She had heard of it, but had never seriously considered it happening to her. The people this happened to were far too glamorous; celebrities and the like. Certainly not to him. She was a widow now. That made her feel old at thirty-seven years and she was sure she didn’t like it. After a week she quietly filed a mortician’s report and sat down to a cup of hot tea. She hadn’t broken it to his family yet, though his sister had been calling. She told her he was away on business. There was no reason to tell them yet. The Quentins could wait another day to hear their little boy wasn’t okay. At that very moment it occurred to her that using her husband’s remains as a hat rack might be poorly received by the general public. And so Anita began the difficult task of finding a place for him. At first she kept him to the study, in front of the fireplace. He kept her company with her tea. But soon she began to find that sitting with the countenance of her dead husband reminded her of her widowhood, so she moved him to the garden and used him to scare the crows away from her tomatoes. He did little to dissuade the crows, however, and soon became their favorite perch. Finally, she hauled him to the attic. She kept the rest of her glass figurines there, and didn’t see why he should be treated any differently. Somehow, it all seemed normal at the time. Everywhere you looked someone was at it. The glass bodies seemed to multiply. When she called her husband’s mother and told her, tearfully, that he had passed away, she burst into hysterics and told her that so had one of the grandchildren. Anita was uncomfortable, and then she hung up. When the man who cut her lawn succumbed as well, she began to worry. Now it was affecting her everyday life, which was something her husband and niece had not generally been part of. Her husband worked constantly and usually slept when he graced her with his presence. Her niece, whose name she couldn’t even remember, lived in Florida. She put entirely too much sugar in her tea and shivered as she drank it. She did miss her husband. Sometimes. And now she would have to trim her own lawn. Her first hint that something might have been a bit off was when she found her neighbor, frozen solid while pulling the weeds in his yard. The next day, while shopping for groceries the bag boy, with a crackle, transformed, still clutching her biscotti. She tenderly wrenched it from his grip, glanced around halfheartedly, and didn’t pay. Then the news reports began to get very tiresome. First it was strange, isolated events. Then it was an epidemic, then a pandemic, and then it was Susan Shepherd reporting to you live from New York City and…crackle. Ting. Suddenly, she wasn’t reporting. Suddenly, she wasn’t even alive. There was panic after that, and lootings and riots, or so Anita saw on the news. She kept to herself these days. Her sister hadn’t called in weeks. She half expected her to be found, phone in hand, sitting at her kitchen table, never to move again. A week later, the police confirmed her suspicions: her sister was found not at the phone but in bed. Three relatives now dead, Anita found in horror that she had run out of tea bags. It had been months since Anita found her husband, and her lawn was long. The four houses around hers couldn’t claim a single opaque resident. She’d taken to not leaving the study for days on end, sitting by the fire with her tea while her husband sat in the attic, staring at a wall. He wasn’t needed in the yard anymore, not since the neighbor had frozen there. Anita came to miss him in the study, but he tended to alienate visitors, of which she found she was having less and less these days. At first, she’d gotten dozens of calls for funerals of her husband’s mother, friends, old boyfriends, but soon even the funerals died off. There were too many to throw. The television only worked sporadically, and when it did it showed news. It told her to lock her doors and windows. It told her there were people who thought this would pass. People who were trying to take things from those who had turned, so they would be wealthy when they and the rest of humanity came out the other end. It used the word anarchy a lot. The futility of the this did not escape Anita, but when the looters came, as the news assured her they would, she thought the best way to be rid of them, and quickly, would be to set out a plate of lemonade for them and to point them in the direction of the attic, where she kept an odd assortment of expensive-looking things that had, at one point, been her grandmother’s. That, she thought, would keep them happy while she kept to the study with her husband, for she hadn’t had use for the china in years, anyway. It annoyed her, though, when they woke her up in the middle of the night. Roland had robbed a lot of houses, before and after it became commonplace, but thought that few had ever looked as empty as this one. He received a terrible shock when Anita spoke. “Hello,” she said, wiping sleep from her eyes with one hand and holding a candle in the other. “Attic’s that way.” Roland had been greeted many ways upon entering a house he planned to rob. This was not one he was used to. “I’m going to have some tea,” she said, and began walking slowly away. Roland’s mind reeled for a moment, and then he set off for the attic. In the kitchen, Anita sleepily sipped Earl Gray when Roland trudged down the stairs with a sack over his shoulder and came upon her. He stopped mid-step and looked at her carefully. “All those people up there…” “The glass ones?” Pause. Sip. “Yeah, the glass ones,” “What about them?” Sip. “Why did you-” “Think of it as a sort of a tomb.” Roland decided he’d stay. Anita mistrusted him at first but soon found it was a great relief just having him around. She was running low on food and it really was lovely to have someone to break into a grocery store with. As much as she knew how low the chances were of her finding anything dangerous, the lonely streets seemed much less so with a companion. He tended the garden, collected rain water for drinking and bathing, and even sometimes sat with her by the fireplace, sharing a seemingly endless stockpile of tea with her, “We’re going to run out of food, you know.” Roland mentioned. “Even just between the two of us, there’s only so long that that store will hold out.” Anita shrugged and stared into her tea. Even she had to admit the great mound of canned goods they had made in the grocery was beginning to run low. Her eyes settled on the fire and it was a moment before she answered. “So what do you suppose we should do?” Roland shrugged. “I don’t know. Leave?” Anita didn’t answer. After two weeks, they had eaten nearly all of the food they had brought back from their last trip to the store and agreed, Anita a little grudgingly, that they would keep walking after this next trip to the grocery and see where it led them. There was nothing for them here, Roland reasoned, and besides, maybe they’d find other people. Their lives became a long journey from food source to convenience store to market to people’s basements, sleeping when they could and traveling as they pleased. They took what they needed, carried what they could, and moved on. Roland led them, taking to this life with complete ease. As they walked, he shouted things back at her like “Lovely, isn’t it?” and she never answered. He found her silence unnerving. Eventually, after weeks of traveling from convenience store to grocery to mini-mall, they came upon a set of high cliffs, with a sheer drop to the sea. Anita had liberated a bottle of wine from the last supermarket they slept in, and the two of them sat with it and watched the sun rise. “I’ve been thinking, Anita,” Roland said gently, “that the world ended.” “No,” was her answer. It was the first time she had spoken in months. “Yes, it did,” he said, with not a little sadness in his voice. “And it forgot to take us with it.” With this thought, he stood up and began the long hike back down the cliffs. Anita looked back after him for a long time. She shattered as she hit bottom. Credited to The Hedonist Originally uploaded on November 7th, 2010"}

All he had asked for were the town's strongest young men to aid him in his cooking. After a week had gone by, the Baron invited the most prestigious of the town's citizens to join him in a tasting session of the feast. The citizens came out of the castle, their bellies full, and assured the town that there was enough food for all of them. \"However,\" Madame Agen said to the people, \"I find that there is one flaw in Baron Vanier's cooking.\" The people raised their heads in curiosity. \"There is no meat in the stew! I cannot find a dish complete without meat.\" The people shook their heads. They could do without meat, but of course the chunky Madame Agen could not. The Baron, who was standing next to Madame Agen during her speech, explained that even though the English had slaughtered their cows and pigs and chickens that he would make a dish that would do without meat. Nevertheless, the people of the town had their bellies filled for that night. It wasn't long until the beggars and lowlifes of the town began to rob people for money once more, and when the Baron saw that, he knew that he had to do something. And so he began preparations for another feast. He spent night upon night trying to think of something that would substitute for meat in the dish, and he finally decided that cabbages would do a decent job of satisfying the flaw that Madame Agen pointed out. Once again, he invited the prestige of the town for a small tasting session. They came out once again with their bellies full, and once again told the town that there was enough food for all of them. But Madame Agen's carnivorous appetite was not satiated. \"The cabbage has the texture of meat, but not the... feel , of meat!\" The Baron, at this point, was slightly irritated at Madame Agen's impossible demands. \"And how exactly will one put that 'feel' of meat into a dish without meat, Mademoiselle Agen?\" She chuckled a bit, and whispered to the Baron, \"Why, with meat, of course!\" Nevertheless, the people of the town had their bellies filled for the night. But the English did not let up on their siege. Raids into the town became more common, and the Baron once again saw the need for another feast. And so he put his best minds of the castle together to create a mixture of some sort that, when cooked, would resemble meat. Eventually, they came up with the mixture, and the Baron went to work on the feast yet again. Afraid of Madame Agen's scoldings, he invited the prestige for an early tasting session, to see if the meat substitute would satisfy a hungry man's taste for meat. But Madame Agen still wanted more. \"Have you tasted meat, Baron Vanier? It simply cannot be recreated in a bottle of liquid! One must have the meat in his hands to create a dish with meat.\" \"Madame Agen!\" The Baron shouted. \"I simply do not have meat!\" \"Then find some,\" she replied. And at that moment the Baron knew what he had to do. \"Madame Agen... a moment, please?\" When the prestige came out, the crowd did not notice Madame Agen to be missing. They did not notice the lack of her scoldings of the Baron's cooking. Nevertheless, the people of the town had their bellies filled for the night, and had the gnawing question of how the Baron got his hands on some of the finest meat they had ever tasted.

{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal", "title": "Untitled", "author": "three", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Suggested Reading", "Historical Archive/PD"], "content": "A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) For Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland from Being a Burden to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Public It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads and cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes. I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the common-wealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation. But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the streets. As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years, upon this important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the cloathing of many thousands. There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast. The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although I apprehend there cannot be so many, under the present distresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture; we neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers: As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art. I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value. I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasie, or a ragoust. I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter. I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 pounds. I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title to the children. Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine months after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom, and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening the number of Papists among us. I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers) to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another child. Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may flea the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen. As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs. A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the want of venison might be well supply'd by the bodies of young lads and maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for want of work and service: And these to be disposed of by their parents if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was generally tough and lean, like that of our school-boys, by continual exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would become breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project, how well soever intended. But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor, a native of the island Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty's prime minister of state, and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet, at four hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear at a play-house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for; the kingdom would not be the worse. Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come. I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of the highest importance. For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the number of Papists, with whom we are yearly over-run, being the principal breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate. Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their landlord's rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a thing unknown. Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children, from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture. Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first year. Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they please. Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in calf, or sow when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage. Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel'd beef: the propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or magnificence to a well grown, fat yearly child, which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other publick entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of brevity. Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper) the remaining eighty thousand. I can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against this proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people will be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire the reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one individual Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or, I think, ever can be upon Earth. Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither cloaths, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants of Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it. Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice. But, as to my self, having been wearied out for many years with offering vain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of success, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which, as it is wholly new, so it hath something solid and real, of no expence and little trouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger in disobliging England. For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it. After all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject any offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent, cheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points. First, As things now stand, how they will be able to find food and raiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly, There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout this kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers, with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe, and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they have since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the impossibility of paying rent without money or trade, the want of common sustenance, with neither house nor cloaths to cover them from the inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable prospect of intailing the like, or greater miseries, upon their breed for ever. I profess, in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work, having no other motive than the publick good of my country, by advancing our trade, providing for infants, relieving the poor, and giving some pleasure to the rich. I have no children, by which I can propose to get a single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and my wife past child-bearing."}

My challenge was to write a story set in a combat environment. Daniel Saxon was born on the move. His parents were Joseph Saxon, a Methodist frontier circuit minister, and Anabelle Westerberg Saxon, herself the daughter of a Swedish Lutheran pastor in Delaware who had been defrocked and excommunicated for embracing the Swedenborgian movement. Daniel's early memories were of constantly changing places and people, many of them blurring into inaccurate composite settings. He had no siblings, and no lasting friendships. Most of his formative years were spent at frontier revival camps, or at Indian missions. Anabelle died when Daniel was an infant, and he had only the vaguest, possibly fabricated memories of her. Joseph and his son met with a detachment of United States soldiers while riding circuit in the Ohio territory during the Northwest Indian War. Joseph Saxon had himself been a colonel in the Continental Army but was now an avowed pacifist. This encounter was Daniel's first impression of what soldiers looked like. Their stylish uniforms immediately attracted him to the military life. His father was determined that Daniel should be a minister like himself, and after inviting the soldiers to one of his revival meetings, they quickly parted ways. Joseph died when Daniel was 16. Against his father's wishes, he moved to Cambridge and enrolled in Harvard to study not the ministry, but secular humanities. He quickly became an admirer of Voltaire, Kant, and Locke. Religion as such could not be further from his ambitions. When war broke out again with Britain over the Indian territories in 1812, he left the university to join the New York militia, where he was commissioned to the rank of Captain at just 20 years old. He was given command of a company of some sixty men, and ordered to march to Lake Ontario, where he was to establish a fort to prevent British amphibious incursions. The land Captain Saxon chose for his new fort was poorly suited to the purpose. He selected a low clearing surrounded by woods about a quarter of a mile from the lake. The ground was permanently moist and rocky, and the clearing itself was barely spacious enough to hold a small post. The mosquitoes were a terror. Nevertheless, they managed to build something from what dry wood they could find, a chest-high ring wall, and some crude earthworks. Saxon also ordered the construction of a short watchtower, which barely cleared the surrounding trees to overlook the lake. No proper barracks were built, only a large wooden awning for the men to sleep under. The fort's one clear advantage was that nobody would ever guess it was there. Captain Saxon named the post Fort Kant. His mission was to watch for British patrols, but there was never any sign of the redcoats. He turned his focus to the matter of shoring up his garrison's provisions for the coming winter, sending out foraging parties and excising supplies from local farms. They eventually planted a vegetable garden. Daniel took to meditating in the evening down by the lake. Sometimes he would see a warship, but never any land forces. Now and again he would drill the men, but that quickly became tiresome. He soon felt his assignment was pointless. The first real excitement came not from the enemy, but among his own men. A certain Private Sawill had gotten into an altercation with one Corporal Dunning. The private had punched the corporal in the nose, killing him. Saxon held a drumhead at his command tent by the lookout tower. There was only one correct disposition: Private Sawill had to die. The man blubbered and sobbed that he never intended for the corporal to be killed. He didn't plead for his life, only that he was sorry. It was a pathetic display, but one that weighed heavily on Saxon's mind. The prisoner was housed in a tent within the fort and an extra section of fence was put up to sequester him from the rest of the garrison. Two militiamen guarded him at all times and he was not to speak to the other men. Sawill's only last request was a Bible. His execution was delayed a few days for a supply party to find one. The best they could manage was an old hymnal, found at a nearby farm. He was shot on the shore of the lake, his executioners having drawn picks, and buried right there. His last words had been merely to repeat that he was sorry. The dead corporal had been buried on that same strip. It wasn't really proper that they should be interned so close together, but it was the only available space. Captain Saxon had given funeral rites for Dunning and now did the same for Sawill. He didn't even believe in God at this point, but was able to perform it from memory based on watching his father do it so many times, not even having to use the hymnal that had been procured. That night Saxon had a dark dream. He dreamt of people falling dead, their blood flowing out onto the ground, and then being swallowed up by the earth. Winter came without the enemy ever rearing his head. Daniel didn't know much about what was happening outside the forested clearing where his tiny fort lay, but he had heard from the commander of the nearest other garrison that the focus of the war had moved westward. With fighting season over, most of the men were suffered to return home for Christmas, though one perished of pneumonia and was buried at that same makeshift graveyard on the lake. Daniel was now almost alone, with just a handful of men who had elected to stay at Fort Kant. They managed to acquire a half-keg of beer and a single bottle of wine for a Christmas celebration of their own. They sang around a fire at the center of the fort until the early morning. When it was time to muster in the spring, some men did not report back, and there were a few new faces. Despite not having a complete complement of troops, Daniel received orders to abandon Fort Kant and march east toward the new front at Lake Erie. He was to join with a company of regulars where a new fort was being built. They took what supplies they could carry and buried the rest. There was no time to demolish the fort, as his orders were to depart immediately. It was on the way to his new post that Saxon had his first engagement. In the early evening, his forward patrol, consisting of six men, stumbled upon some British irregulars in an aspen grove. Fire was exchanged, and when the main New York force rushed in, the British retreated, melting into the encroaching darkness. Two enemies had been killed. One was captured but let go as they did not have time to transport a prisoner. Saxon's company had lost one man, and one had been wounded. They hastily buried the three dead men while a party was detached to find a spot to camp for the night. They recommended a low-lying pine grove, where it would be difficult for potential enemy reinforcements to find them. The needle- and stick-laden ground was bloody uncomfortable, but any intruder would have a hard time approaching without being heard. It rained that night, which made further confrontation that much more unlikely. Daniel had a repetition of his dream from before, people dying and bleeding out on the ground, and swallowed up in a great pit. This time there was an additional detail: everything was on fire, and smoke blanketed the dark sky. Having slept a few hours, they decamped just before dawn. Saxon diverted his course somewhat, but his next destination remained the same: a frontier town en route to the site of the new fort. There they would commend the wounded militiaman to the care if the townspeople, rest, and resupply. When they arrived, Daniel realized he had been there before. The town was one of the many he had been to with his father. In fact, the tiny local church had started as one of Joseph Saxon's missions. The company was larger than the population of the town itself. Several of the local families had taken after Joseph's pacifism, and refused to house the militiamen. Daniel considered putting the town under effective martial law, but with the town being this close to the enemy, he decided it was best to be a good neighbor. Those who could not find housing camped outside in a farmer's field. The local minister was himself new to the town. Barely older than Saxon, he had been an Episcopalian rector in Boston before joining the Methodist movement. The two talked at the small town tavern, about their different life experiences, when the minister asked the captain if he believed in God. Daniel lied and said he did, but only in the general sense. \"I know that the Indians believe in the Great Spirit who created everything. Likewise the Jews and Muhammadans worship essentially the same god. Jefferson believes in a Divine Providence; I reckon that's what I believe in. I don't comprehend the need for a church or synagogue, though.\" The minister merely nodded. Daniel wanted to ask if he himself believed in God, as his face left him unsure. Their conversation ended with the minister inviting Daniel to service the next day, and him declining. Some of his men did attend, and when it was finished, they formed up and began the next leg of their journey. *** Major Thomas Greenwald, officer of the fort currently under construction, had been waiting over a fortnight for his expected reinforcements. Neither side in the war had yet gained naval hegemony over Lake Erie, and the fort was being built in fluid territory. If the fort was discovered it would take but a hundred British soldiers or Confederacy warriors to take it. He gazed over the lake. Not a vessel in sight, but that meant nothing. Greenwald privately intended to surrender or abandon the fort if the British won the expected upcoming naval showdown, regardless of his orders. His quartermaster ran up the hill where he was perched, informing him that somebody was approaching the fort by horse. The major could see him from there, clearly an inexperienced rider, bolting up the path like a drunk lunatic. The man said he was from the militia company that was supposed to reinforce the fort. They had been ambushed by Indians and annihilated, the captain left for dead. He claimed to be the last survivor; though others would later be found, Saxon's company had been effectively wiped out. Greenwald cursed. Not only would his reinforcements not arrive at all, but there were Indians about, and bodies to recover out there. He wanted to literally shoot the messenger. Barely able to contain himself, he sent as many men as he could afford to the scene of the massacre. They brought back as many bodies as they found, but Captain Saxon's was not among them. Late October, 1814 Colonel Peter Silver had now fought three wars against the British. A young officer in the Revolution, and then in the Northwest Indian War, he now commanded a battalion of rangers in this latest frontier war. With the war drawing to a close, he expected to retire soon, maybe buy a plantation in Tidewater, or live out his days as a merchant or statesman in New England. His current orders were peculiar: he was to deploy north to Lake Ontario, where the war had long since ended, to investigate a potential mutiny. Apparently, a former militia officer was encouraging soldiers and militiamen to desert and mass at the site of an abandoned fort. It was rumored that even some British soldiers had joined them. Upon arriving at a nearby town they gained context. One Daniel Saxon, previously thought to have been killed in battle, was now a self-styled preacher and prophet. He claimed to have received divine visions foreshadowing the imminent end of the world, and was urging troops to abandon the war in preparation. He was said to be baptizing people in the lake in anticipation of an expected next age. Silver's lieutenant, Major Bowers, had a predictable suggestion: march right up to the fort, bayonets fixed, in an overwhelming show of force. He was showing his knavery. Prior to becoming a soldier the major had never in his life met a negro, talked to an Indian, or known a Catholic. Of course people preparing for the end of the world sent him into alarm. For his own part, Silver had had some dealings with these frontier revivalists, and knew they were odd but for the most part harmless. He had a better plan: send in spies to see what this Daniel Saxon was all about. Two soldiers were sent, pretending to have deserted. They stayed among the sectarians for four days before sneaking out of the camp at night. When they reported back, they had a wild story. This prophet was a highly energetic man, delivering his apocalyptic message in mesmerizing speeches that bewitched those in attendance. Even the two spies were enthralled. The assembly would erupt in spontaneous outbursts of foot stomping, shouting, or yelling in what sounded like gibberish, and the two men could scarce resist joining in. It was like he had cast a spell over all of them. During meal times, there was a bizarre form of participatory prayer in which people would interject at will, and afterward they would sometimes break into small groups for silent meditation, until one would receive a revelation and share it. For Colonel Silver, these were all things he'd heard before. But for Major Bowers and the other officers, they portended a revolution. The Colonel decided to speak to Saxon himself. He arrived at the fort one Saturday, the rangers hiding about in the woods in case of an emergency. The once small clearing on which the fort lay had been widened to make room for the pilgrims. The colonel passed a number of tree stumps as he walked the path up to the site. Up in a wooden tower he saw a man whom he presumed to be Saxon, preaching down to the assembly below. Over the chest-high wooden wall he could see people - mostly men, but a few women and children as well - packed like matches around the tower, some having to look on from outside the wall where there were tents and sleeping sacks. Some wore their army and militia uniforms, including a couple wearing red jackets. There was at least one Indian there as well, and some negroes. For his own part, the man assumed to be Saxon wore a black alb. The man in the tower wrapped up his preaching just as Silver reached the bare entryway to the fort. Despite the small size of the fort, the colonel had trouble making his way through the congregants to Saxon. He reached him at the bottom of the tower, where he was now sitting in a tent. Whatever was said between the colonel and the renegade militia captain would never be known, for something caused the rangers hiding in the autumn foliage to open fire at that point. Shooting over the low wall, they felled a number of those gathered, and as one of the few there who were armed fired back, a second volley was poured out upon them. A third was discharged at the mass of those attempting to flee. The ranger battalion well outnumbered Saxon's little mission, so whether it was their intention or not, they killed almost everyone in the fort, including Saxon and Silver. The rangers took Silver's body and buried it on the shore of the lake. They then interned the rest of the dead in a mass grave along the newly cleared path to the fort. Finally, they burned the fort and the wooden tower to the ground. Within a generation the place would become just a footnote and a failed prophecy.

Only that", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Diary/Journal", "Mental Illness"], "content": "I remember the first night I heard it. The air, it was brisk, but humid and thick. And I had still been asleep, snuggled within my blankets. It was as early as 7:30pm and I had only been asleep for about an hour. I lived in a, disconnected, secluded area, wooded, damp and usually foggy. The weather was always humid, just warm enough and just cold enough; perfect for a person like myself who preferred the loneliness of the woods. During the night you would hear the wolves howl at the moon, the owls would hoot in song, sometimes seemingly using the howls of the wolves to pitch a tune as well. That night, the voices began. They were subtle at first. I heard what I thought to be whispers in my ear from outside the dream. Yet, I awoke to no one but the wolves and owls outside. I was not one who frightened easily so, I simply brushed the occurrence off and laid my head back down. However, after I had once again fallen asleep, the voice returned. And it didn't whisper, is spoke clearly. Not loudly, but more of a quieted indoor voice. I awoke once more, and again, was not scared, but more frustrated that something clearly wanted to keep me up but I could not for the life of me, discern what it may be. I do believe in ghosts, and things that normal people do not typically consider a possibility, or deny possibility of simply because there is not enough evidence to suggest its existence. In fact I often conversed with some spirits. Spirits whom had become trapped in our plane of existence, who either were prohibited from returning to the plane beyond the veil, or were being held in this world by something they cannot find. I do not know what lies beyond the veil. Only that, it is said to house some of the worlds darkest, dirtiest, most unruly evils and secrets that even the brightest, genius prodigy of humanity could never hope to place a title upon or describe accurately. I cannot even say what my description of them is, would even be a scratch upon the surface. It houses evils of those calibers, and it also house evils which are not inherently evil but instead have committed evil, but for good reason, and were punished. It also houses spirits who were violently ripped from their previous life in our plane, whom have since become angry, vengeful and spiteful beings, that prey on those who do wrong to innocent people when given the chance to return to our plane. I do believe in ghosts. And I had first thought that what was waking me was perhaps a harmless spectre, playfully awaking me, or perhaps unknowingly doing so. I called out to it, if it were there, and asked it to please allow me to fall asleep once more. Of course there was no audible answer, but, I never expect an answer, so I simply allowed my words some time to reach, and laid back to my pillow once more. I once again, fell asleep. This time I was left alone for much longer. I dreamt of a large figure, about 4 feet taller than I, myself being 6'2\". It stood before me, a large silhouette, with huge round white eyes, lacking pupils, but they were bloodshot, as if he had been awake for weeks with no intent on sleeping. It did not speak. It only looked down at me, into my eyes. As if it were staring directly into my soul. Into my deepest reaches of my heart. This creature could see my weakest points, my darkest fears. It could show me my worst ideas come to life. It did not speak. It just stared. A cold, disgusting, terrifyingly blank stare, that pierced you, and yielded feelings of fear that one could never imagine. This feeling, it was horrifying. It was a feeling as though something was physically within your chest and your stomach. It writhed and clenched like an animal being tormented. It was inconceivable. So much so that even turning one's head was a feat beyond even the highest levels of bravery and comprehension of fear. One could say that you feel as though your surroundings have burned away and all that remains is you, and the creature before you, staring silently into your soul. The silence began to taunt me, as if hungering to hear my burst into tears at just how terrifying this feeling was. I awoke abruptly the next morning, clothes soaked in sweat, shaking and breathing heavily, heart racing. I stumbled downstairs and into the kitchen to make my coffee. I fancied cuban coffee in particular. But today I just made a simple french vanilla. I filtered it through the coffee filters and into my cup, and sat down at my couch to watch TV, and ponder on my dream. The TV went on for a while; I typically indulged in my younger side watching cartoons and popular teenage shows. Then, like the night before, the voice came back. However it was now no longer alone. There were others. Two from what I could discern. They spoke clearly and in full power, but they sounded distant, as though someone was far away, in another room perhaps, trying to speak to me in a full, audible tone but not realizing they're too far out of range to speak properly. I paced through the house, and even around the surrounding grounds nearest my house, and found nobody, i found nothing. Nothing, nobody was making the noises, they were just there. They gained volume, babbling, yelling insults at me, overlapping one another to extents. My head light and legs weakening, I stumbled back to my house, feeling my balance crumble beneath my every step. I struggled to the couch, as the voices got louder, and increased in frequency. The feeling of their voices was like hot spikes. Like a burning feeling that grew in strength every time they uttered a phrase. The pain was indescribable. It was like being in a room with thousands of people shouting almost point blank, directly into your ear, at their loudest possible audible levels, pummeling insults and just utterly incomprehensible phrases straight into my skull with unparalleled levels of force. The pressure within my head built to boggling levels and I eventually passed out, after what had seemed like hours. I woke up the next morning, headache pounding against the walls of my skull still. The voices had finally silenced. But their words stained my sanity. I stumbled upward and then back down onto the couch. I could barely hold myself up. This continued, for about an hour, and I could again feel the voices coming back. I began, immediately to scream out, as if my body had given out at this point and I was no longer able to contain my frustration with the voices I could not find the sources of, that pounded their insults and anger instilled words into my brain with such force. They screamed back into my skull. My head felt like it was just ready to split open from the strength. It hurt, the pain was unbelievable. For days I suffered through constant screaming, and insults, anger, frustration, confusion, I laid upon the floor and just covered my ears for days, screaming out to the air where none could lift me from this pain and agony. Today I still feel the voices.... They're yelling into my skull even at this very moment. They speak to me about the woman in my dreams. I have seen her. Almost all of my dreams were always about her. She was of unparalleled beauty. She always smiled. She didn't dawn a big smile in my dreams. But it was a smile that you could not help but smile along with. She never spoke. She only smiled and looked into my eyes. I always felt as though I recognized her but I could never figure out who she was. It was frustrating. Until the voices came. They spoke to me about her. They told me who she was. We were married. For years, we lived with one another and we spent our time with each other almost constantly. We lived in each other's embrace. Exchanging kisses, giving to each other our secrets to keep. Bedded we would intertwine, the feelings of each other's skin against one another, my lips to her skin and trailing down her body. It was bliss to remember after so long. But the voices, they say she died. She suffered from cancer, she had for a long time, it slowly began to kill her, painfully. She suffered in agony in a hospital bed, me at her side, desperately trying to find a way to ease her pain, as she lay crying, hoping for something to stop the pain. When she had finally passed I fell deep into a depression. I would wager a guess that is why I live alone, as I had even forgotten the reason for that as well. As I sobbed, the pain of their voices pounding in my head and the pain of remembrance built within me and I could feel it getting stronger. My heart ached, my mind throbbing in unison. My eyes flooded tears like I had not cried before in my life. The voices say they are angry with me because they are remnants of her. And they're angry because I allowed her to die, because I did not save her. They scream their hatred into my skull, louder, piercing my eardrums in contempt. My heart is slowly beginning to break as I sob into my hands. I blame myself for her death. It's all my fault, she didn't deserve to die, but I let her die. There must have been something I could have done. That was about a week ago.... I think.... I cannot recall anymore. I have lost track of time. I just, sit alone in the basement, with the voices in my head, at all... times.... seeing figures in the darkness, leering at me. They're disgusted with me. What a failure of a husband I was to let her die. How could I... How could I....."}

A mere two months before the Stock Market crashed, doubts about how the market was moving ended up convincing him to sell his shares for a hefty payout. As many of the nearby businesses began to fail, in came Christoph with the purchase. He did this many times, consolidating and spinning his newly acquired companies' assets for quick money. This practice made him obscenely wealthy. Unfortunately for Mr. Laurie, he only got to enjoy his wealth for nine months before dying in the midst of 1934. The funeral procession was lacking in number due to the hard times. The few attendees were so engrossed in conversation with each other that none noticed the unwelcome, raggedly dressed - where there were clothes to be had - man who sneakily slipped a hand into the open casket and absconded with the recently deceased's well-polished shoes on each foot. Jason Marlow hadn't expected the shoes to fit; he was just happy to have shoes, but his happiness amplified two-fold upon the added comfort. With a growling stomach and just enough coins in his possession, the poverty stricken man decided to stop at a nearby restaurant in celebration of his lucky acquisition. Barely had he passed through the door, then did a hand hit him in the back... in a friendly, welcoming manner. The mastermind of the friendly swat crossed into the homeless man's field of vision, stroking his beard as he spoke. “Mr. Laurie, always a pleasure to see you! I'd heard talk that you were dead. Glad to see it ain't so.” Jason Marlow was confused how he could be mistaken for a regular, especially the dead man who he had just stolen from. Still, he did his best to take advantage of the situation and replied in the hopes that he didn't blow it, “That's quite the mix-up on someone's part. Confusin' me with a stiff, unbelievable. Nice to see you too, pal.” The restaurateur ceased stroking his feathery beard and moved on to rubbing his bald dome in contemplation as he momentarily gave a confused look. “You don't sound right, Mr. Laurie. You might be coming down with a cold or something, best be careful. Last thing you need is to catch pneumonia and make them rumors a reality. Tell me what you want to eat and I'll get it whipped up and you fixed back into shape!” “I'll have a hamburger with coffee.” The worker released a thunderous laugh as though his customer had said the funniest thing of all time. Either he was easily amused or a kissass. After ceasing, he replied, “Mr. Laurie, you know we don't serve hamburgers. You want your regular steak and coffee?” Marlow gave a nod and let out a sigh of relief after the ridiculous man disappeared behind a door he assumed led to the kitchen. A short time later, the man reappeared with a cup of coffee. The drifter chose to give a nod of thanks in the hopes that the man would leave, instead of opening his mouth. He was pleasantly surprised when his hopes were met. A chunk of time elapsed before the man returned, sitting down a plate in front of him. Much to Jason's dismay, the steak was pink and dripping a rather alarming amount of blood. Having decided to try and maintain his mistaken identity so that he might dine and dash, he kept his mouth shut on the matter. Well, actually he opened his mouth, chewed and washed as much of the matter as he could manage down with his coffee. The strange man routinely checked on him as he ate, never giving him enough time to sneak away. If only the diner had another customer, then perhaps he could have left by now; curses. He sat solemnly, pretending to drink from his empty cup and watching for an opening; finally one presented itself and he made for the door. The employee turned around with frightening speed. He was on point as if he had radar built inside him and asked, “In a hurry, Mr. Laurie?” “Yeah,” came Jason Marlow's terrified reply. “You sound a lot better! I hope you enjoyed your meal. Thanks for buying the diner and keeping us afloat, boss!” The attempted dine and dasher internally smacked himself. Once again, the streets of Pittsburgh lie ahead of him. A realm of many possibilities, but few - if any - that would lead to his employment, or housing for that matter. It was because of this futility that he would drift without any destination in mind and just try to seize whatever opportunities he saw, but today was different. He wandered again without certainty, yes, but this time he felt as if there were some purpose behind it all. The man felt as though he was being guided by inexplicable force, but did not attempt to stray. Jason's trek led him to a large, three-story building with the words: 'Gadenberry Soap Company' plastered atop its roof. The place felt familiar, but he couldn't figure why. The urge to enter washed over him, growing stronger and stronger until he relented. Save for the walls, floor, and the door that hung at the opposite end, the front room was entirely bare. Despite the trepidation, Marlow carried himself across the empty room, his footsteps echoing throughout. Shakily, he reached out an arm and flung open the door to reveal a rail-less stairway. The split second his feet came to rest on the first step, his brain instinctively knew that there was no turning back. With each successive step ascended, Jason Marlow became more confident. By the time that he reached the final floor, he was a different person entirely. Christoph Laurie threw open the door to his former office. A scrawny, well-dressed, glasses-wearing man, who might match most people's imagery of an accountant, looked up from the chair in which he was seated. The seat-warmer's eye's bulged with fear from behind their frames when he registered the man that stood before him. The retired judge slowly strolled into the room, relishing the other man's fear which practically lingered through the air. “Mi-Mister Laurie,” the seated man exclaimed as he rose and slowly backed up into the large window behind him. “Heywood.” “Why? Why in the hell won't you die? You should be dead thrice over now!” The business owner cracked his knuckles, continuing to edge toward the room's other occupant, and replying, “I don't like to leave my work unfinished.” “That makes two of us,” exclaimed Heywood with a shrill cry as he reached into a pocket underneath his jacket and retrieved a small pistol. Two gunshots rang out as Christoph Laurie charged the man who had stolen one of his many companies. Heywood let out a grin as he saw blood spew from his former boss's chest; at least one of the bullets had hit, if not both. However, the gunshot victim had enough momentum that the wounds didn't matter and he tumbled forward into his target. Heywood's grin dropped and a visage of fear overrode all expression as Christoph's body made contact with his. The two fell forward, shattering the window, falling and flailing through the air to the ground below. No screams, only glass shattering and a bone-breaking thud could be heard, were there anyone around to bear witness. A tiny funeral procession was held in honor of Christoph Laurie, even smaller than the last. No one paid any attention to the body on display. A man and woman were off to the side chatting, a well-to-do married couple. Their discussion was one that everyone present was having with each other. “This is the fourth time, Joel!” “Martha, I swear this is the last of his funerals we'll go to. Regardless of if this body ends up not being his.” “At least the first one they buried looked like him! I've heard that two of the times they exhumed his grave, the bodies didn't even look similar!” “It's so peculiar. The person on display at every funeral looks exactly like him and we've seen them buried. It's almost like someone is swapping bodies as a cruel joke.” Well, there was one person who wasn't talking about the oddity that was Christoph Laurie's many funerals. This person, a destitute man, slowly and secretly inched toward the dead man's fancy shoes with a look of hope in his eyes. Written by Doom Vroom Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

It’s not a story that’s “real”. It’s not one of those \"friend of a friend\" stories. It’s the one story from my childhood that I vividly remember and have yet to get the memories of that twisted night out of my head. A little background information first; as far back as I can remember I had a fascination and love of horror movies. From a young age, I would read countless horror story compilations that were sold at school book-drives, and since five I would watch many horror classics, such as Halloween, The Elm Street series, the Friday the 13th's, with my mother. We even saw Hostel together when I was eleven (Which personally I was a bit let down even at that age). But I digress. To sum it up, blood, gore, and essentially the feeling of horror and terror were something I was more able to handle as opposed to the average person. I was not scared easily. Where I lived is also relevant. My house was a typical middle-class, suburban, two-story home at the back of a cul-de-sac. My room is above the garage with a great view of our big back yard. There’s a little roof outstretching from right below that window and oftentimes in summer I would sit on the roof at night and watch the stars. Half of the yard closest to the house is mowed; there is a little hill that leads back into taller, unkempt grass, that is technically not part of our property so we are not obligated to attend to it. Inside of that tall grass a small pond is there and a tiny creek running behind it mostly used for drainage and run-off. The road beyond that is the same one that my old high school is on. It was a five-minute walk from my house if I cut through the back yard, which I so often did. It was one warm, summer night in my hometown of Waukesha, Wisconsin just after my freshman year of high school, when I was 15. It was a typical evening where I had my windows open as I was trying to fall asleep. I had, and still have, a terrible habit of staying up far too late, not like one or 2 AM late, but closer to three or 4 AM, and some nights around five in the morning. I was staying up watching sub-par, late night television, flipping through music I just recently downloaded onto my iPod, basically just staying up because it was summer and I could. It was about three in the morning when I abruptly stopped whatever it was I was doing and ran to my window. I heard a very loud, albeit short, yell. It shocked me because it was so abrupt, so I looked out of the window, waited there listening for a few minutes to see if there was going to be more, but there wasn't. I chalked it up to neighborhood kids playing some night game like \"host in the graveyard\". I looked into my neighbor’s living room window and saw some lights faintly and slowly flashing so I assumed that they were watching some movie. In hindsight I would realize I was mistaken. About 40 minutes later, I heard the scream again. It was the same tone, the same voice producing the bloodcurdling scream. The difference between this scream and the previous one was that it was longer, louder and more agonized. The way it sounded, it was one of those screams that you just instinctively know something is wrong. I ran back to the window to see if I could see anything, hoping that it was just my neighbor's movie, but I could tell it wasn't, the screams were at odd intervals and too far apart. Looking in my neighbor's window I saw the same slowly flashing lights, and stared at them long enough this time for me to realize it was some decorative light they had in their house and was never a TV set in the first place. I immediately went to my parents' room, I tried waking my mother, alerting to her that I heard someone scream, and that I don’t know what was going on, or if I should do anything. It was useless. She was in too deep of a sleep. “It’s a dream, just go back to bed,” she mumbled in a voice that made it painfully obvious she was sleep talking. I went back to my room, trying to deny that anything was happening. Besides, if it were something bad that was happening I’m sure someone in the surrounding houses that were closer to the noise would call if it were urgent. The noise was definitely close-by, just around my school that I get to by crossing my back yard, but there were definitely houses closer to where the origin of the noise came from. I went back to my window. I waited for a bit more. Five, maybe ten minutes and I finally decided to try and go to bed. And that’s when I heard it, the same yell again. Same tone, same male voice, but this time he was screaming, very clearly, in an agonizing, pleading shout, “Help me! Someone help me!\" My heart sank and I was overcome with a feeling of fear and dread. The severity of the position I was in overwhelmed me and I was frozen at my window trying to hear something more. About a minute, maybe less, passed and that’s when I saw them. The first came bursting through a canopy of trees at the edge of the creek. It was a figure, definitely male, running through the tall grass of my backyard, sprinting. It looked as if he was running for his life. Shortly behind was another figure, seemingly male, about the first figure's height following him, running directly behind him and quickly shortening their distance apart. As quickly as they appeared in the tall grass, they disappeared from my view just as quick. I ran downstairs to see if I could better see what was going on from my patio doors. As I got to the doors I heard a final yell, but this time the yell lasted for maybe a half a second, and sounded like it was cut short. I assumed the worst. Panicking, I checked every single door and window in my house to make sure it was locked and sealed tightly. It took me about five minutes to complete the task. However, as I was checking the last window, I saw a figure emerge from some trees near the tiny pond that stretched to my neighbor’s backyard. The figure began to make its way between the houses when it stopped. It just stopped, and I could not help but to stare at it, to see what it would do, what move it would make next. After about ten seconds I became disturbed. The feeling of dread and terror intensified and I was frozen, just watching it. The way it stood there, still and un-moving, as if it could see me as if it was watching me. I slowly began to back away, however, when I did that all I could make out in the darkness was it raising its arm and waving at me. It did see me. I was sure of that now. Horrified, of whatever it was or whoever it was, I ran to my room. I shut my window immediately, closed the blinds and then proceeded to turn on all the lights in my room, watch every last stupid infomercial that was on TV and call everyone in my contact list to try and calm me down. I didn't sleep until the next afternoon. As my parents awoke the next day, I told them what I saw but left out the part of the figure waving at me, as not to frighten them. They were shocked but didn't have any idea of what to do, so pretty much left it as a freaky story. I then took my dog out as we all woke up and the sun solidified its place in the sky. The sunlight helped me regain some of my composure. As he was out doing his business, my dog trotted over to the tall grass, which is where we usually take him to go number two. Seeing as it’s already overgrown, we don’t clean it up back there. As he was sniffing around, he picked up a trail and he eventually followed it. He dragged me along and I was slowly realizing it was the trail of the person from last night. Before I could begin to wonder where it would end up, I saw it, or rather smelled it. Behind a bundle of sticks and other overgrown foliage, next to the pond, was the body of the man that was screaming. His throat slit wide open, stomach carved out and entrails strewn about in my very own backyard. His one eye had an \"X\" carved over it and his mouth was open, frozen in the most twisted of screams. All the gory horror movies I had seen could not prepare me for the nose burning, visceral and putrid smell of a dead body. It nearly knocked me off my feet, and I will never be able to forget what that horrific odor smelled like, mixed with the metallic scent of the blood, that had since seeped into the edge of the water, giving our pond a slight hint of crimson. I ran upstairs and told my parents immediately, half crying, and in complete shock. The ambulance, police and coroners came. They questioned me a bit, not too much. I’m pretty sure my mom said she found him so they wouldn't keep bothering me with questions, especially in my shocked, almost catatonic state. We would later find out that the boy was 20 years old and raped shortly before he was murdered. It took me weeks to be able to sleep at night again after that. Since then I've always had a feeling of guilt. There are nights I feel like I maybe could have stopped it, been a hero at 15, saved a life, stopped a killer. I wish I did something. I was just so terrified. I was more scared than I had ever been in my life. I was frozen with fear. The most terrifying part of the whole ordeal, however, was not seeing the body. The thing about that night that rattles me to my core, the one image that has since been burned into my brain and haunts me on that occasional night, was when I ran upstairs right after it waved to me. I shut my blinds, turned on the lights and watched TV all night. But there was one last moment, where I cracked open my blinds, just to see if dawn was approaching. As I peeked out I saw someone standing on my roof, outside my window with his eyes as close to the glass as possible, just staring at me. Watching me. I will never forget those eyes, those twisted, bloodshot, yellow eyes."}

Absolute, utter rubbish,” Seneca lamented with a distraught shake of his head as he glowered down at the sale catalogue for the evening’s auction. “Mothman, if you keep letting your selections go downhill like this, pretty soon there won’t be anything distinguishing this place from Orville’s Ostentatious Orifice of Offal, or whatever it is he calls it.” Meremoth Mothman’s posture noticeably tightened at the comparison to his lowbrow competitor, Seneca’s comment evidently having struck a nerve. The sharp-boned, beak-nosed, hunchbacked man’s dark frock coat, long black hair, and red-tinted spectacles made it easy to guess where he had gotten his moniker. Anyone stumbling upon him in the woods after dark could easily have been forgiven for not immediately recognizing him as human. They would not be forgiven by him, but they could be forgiven. “Bucklesby sells a random hodgepodge of forgeries and idolatries of questionable provenance and reliability to anyone who walks through his doors,” Mothman reminded him, a defensive edge cutting into his raspy, tinny voice. “I am a purveyor of nothing but genuine preternatural artifacts with well-documented attributes, and my showroom and auctions are by invitation only, available solely to carefully vetted occultists. You’ll find no monkey paws or mogwais here, Chamberlin.” “Kindly excuse Seneca, Meremoth. He hasn’t been sleeping well and is none too pleased with how the Order’s situation with Emrys has been progressing,” Crowley politely defended his business partner, though the booming and monotone voice from his gramophone horn made it sound more like an order than a request. The bobbing brain in the vat wheeled his clockwork contraption a little closer to Seneca, his otherworldly aura increasing slightly as he read the glossy pamphlet he was holding. “Yes. I heard about your debacle at Pendragon Hill earlier this year,” Mothman said, unable to hide his schadenfreude, if indeed he was even trying to do so. “The three of you messed up so badly that the Grand Adderman is now relocating the entire quantity of Sigil Sand to Adderwood Manor just to try to salvage it? Is that right?” “Nein, the purification went as well as it could have gone,” the pale, gaunt, and hairless revenant known as Raubritter insisted. “The Grand Adderman simply had unreasonably high standards for what ‘purified’ means. With such a ritual, some lingering residue of ectocosmic miasma is to be expected. Is basic thaumaturgical theory, yes?” “It’s Ivy’s and Envy’s problem now, is what it is, and I’m not even sure what they’re trying to do with the Sand,” Seneca said dismissively. “I do. They’re trying to fix your mess,” Mothman reminded him. “Enough, both of you. We’re not here to fight over petty matters of personal accountability or existential threats; we’re here to fight over priceless forbidden treasures!” Crowley proclaimed. “Just a reminder, Mothman, that I’ll be making all my bids orally as it’s impractical for me to use a paddle.” “Not a problem, Mr. Crowley. I’m always happy to accommodate the specific needs of my valued patrons,” Mothman nodded. “And in your case, I’m certain I’ll have no problem telling who the speaker is.” “Frauleins! Frauleins!” Raubritter barked, rudely gesturing to a pair of young waitresses holding sterling hors d’oeuvres platters. They each politely excused themselves from the guests they were serving and moved across the room as quickly as they could without risking losing their cargo. “Yes sir? Something from the bar? Or would you care to try some seafood hors d’oeuvres?” the blonde one asked with a painfully fake smile. “There’s baked clams, crab cakes, salmon puffs, prosciutto-wrapped shrimp, lobster stuffed mushroom caps, caviar on bruschetta –” “Nein! Nein! Nein!” Raubritter cut her off with a swift chopping motion of his hand. “Due to elements of Rabbinical alchemy used in my transmogrification, I can partake of nothing Leviticus condemns as an abomination!” “The… salmon and caviar are Kosher, sir,” the dark-haired waitress said tentatively, gently holding her platter out towards him. Raubritter responded with a cold stare through his tinted, hexagonal spectacles before turning to face his host. “Meremoth, please to be explaining the Aryan and Oriental Frauleins here,” he demanded. “Why are you not using Pascal’s girls?” “Because the Darling Twins have been worse than usual lately and Pascal’s not willing to let their staff work at any venue where they might show up,” Mothman explained. “They’re not coming here tonight though, are they?” Crowley asked in alarm, wheeling back slightly and quickly checking to see where the exits were. “They’re not invited, and I’m not auctioning off anything of theirs, but if they do show up you know the protocol,” Mothman replied. “Never mind the Darlings, Crowley. Raubritter raises a good point,” Seneca interjected. “This is an exclusive event of the Ophion Occult Order, and Mothman was just going on about how carefully vetted his guests were. What about your staff, Meremoth? Where exactly did you pick up these two-bit strumpets?” “No need to fret, Chamberlin. They’re locals,” Mothman assured him. “A few years back they stumbled into the Cuniculi and had an encounter with one of the Cryptoids down there; one of your experiments, Crowley, if I’m not mistaken.” “What? That’s preposterous! I don’t toss my failed experiments into the Cuniculi like it’s some sort of public utility! The very idea is an egregious affront to my acumen as both an alchemist and Adderman!” Crowley shouted with deeply embellished indignation. “Was it the cluster of ganglia wrapped in the prehensile nerve fibers?” Raubritter asked. The dark-haired girl responded with a squeamish nod, reluctant to even speak of the incident. “I’ve run into that Unmensch before as well. Most unpleasant, and quite obviously Crowley’s handiwork.” “And why is that? Because it’s a brain monster, you automatically associate it with me?” Crowley demanded, shaking around furiously inside his vat. “I take supreme umbrage to these specious allegations against both myself and my prestigious body of work!” “My apologies, Professor Crowley. I didn’t mean to impugn upon your person or profession,” Mothman huffed a half-hearted apology, shaking his head slightly in disdain. “As I was saying, the incident of course came to the attention of the Order. Since these girls recently came of age, I reached out to properly induct them across the Veil and offer them a position. You know better than any of us how hard it is to find good help that can be trusted around the occult, Seneca. If you know any daughters of ancient and arcane bloodlines who are also willing to work as cocktail waitresses, then kindly share their number.” Seneca pursed his lips, but didn’t argue the point. He instead focused his gaze back upon the two girls, trying to put his finger on exactly what it was about them that he found so unsettling. “What are your names, girls?” he asked. “Halcyon, sir, and this is Emma,” the blonde girl replied. “Halcyon? That’s a ludicrously pretentious name,” he scoffed. “Seriously? My name’s pretentious?” she hissed softly through clenched teeth. Seneca straightened his posture, looking like a cobra coiled to strike. All of his fellow Addermen took a step back, knowing that he had never been the type to tolerate insolence from a subordinate. And Emma knew that Halcyon wasn’t one to tolerate disparagement from anyone. “Everyone calls her Halcy, sir,” she said with a nervous laugh, stepping in between them to prevent the situation from escalating. “I apologize for her disrespectful comment, but we’re just new to this and still a little confused by your Order’s… distinctive customs. She just thought that her full name might fit in a bit better around here. But Mr. Mothman was right; we’re not daughters of ancient and arcane bloodlines, so Halcyon is probably a bit pretentious for day-to-day use. We’ll take care not to step out of line like that again; I promise.” She hung her head contritely and gently jabbed Halcyon with her elbow, urging her to do the same. “Sorry,” she muttered, averting her defiant gaze away from Chamberlin. Seneca cast a questioning glance towards Mothman, who merely shrugged in response. “If you want me to throw her out over that then you’re going to have to explain to my guests why we’re short-staffed this evening,” he said. Groaning in resignation, Seneca swallowed his bile and let the insult slide. “So then, Halcy, that incident in the Cuniculi was your only encounter with the paranormal before meeting Mothman here, was it?” he asked. “ Mm - hmm ,” Halcyon hummed without opening her mouth. “It’s the only one on record, and the only one they’ve ever spoken of in public, as far as we can tell,” Mothman replied. “Will that do, Seneca, or are you just dead set on keeping these girls from doing their jobs?” Chamberlin continued to eye Halcyon suspiciously. He was certain she was lying, but without anything concrete to support his intuition, he could do nothing without causing a scene. “Very well. Off with you then,” he said with a dismissive wave of his right hand while using the left to snatch a salmon puff off of Halcyon’s platter. The girls bowed politely, and resumed their rounds of distributing hor d’oeuvres and taking drink orders. “Why’d you have to back-talk him?” Emma whispered as soon as they were out of earshot. “It slipped; I’m sorry,” Halcyon apologized. “He’s just such an asshole. Strumpet means prostitute, right?” “You could have ruined everything,” Emma reminded her. “Just hold in there until the auction starts.” “I will. Don’t worry,” she promised. Making sure that no one was watching, she pocketed one of the crab cakes, feeding it to the crimson-eyed black rats that were nesting in her dress. “Almost showtime, little guys.” *** “Welcome, my fellow Addermen, to tonight’s auction. I’m your host and auctioneer for this evening, Meremoth Mothman,” Mothman introduced himself from the podium, gleaming wooden gavel in hand. Seated before him in leather back chairs too ornate for their purpose were roughly forty members of the Ophion Occult Order, most of them with numbered paddles in hand as they eagerly awaited their chance to bid on Mothman’s latest offerings. “Our first lot for this evening is a Baphometic Crucifix, believed to have been created in the Black Forest region of Germany at some point during the Burning Times,” Mothman said as Halcyon and Emma carried out a large wooden crucifix which featured the goat-headed Baphomet suffering in place of Christ. “When hung upside-down in the presence of a sincere devotee of any of the Abrahamic faiths, but Catholics in particular, the figure of Baphomet will begin to weep human blood and generate shadowy apparitions to torment the poor papist. The blood is female, most likely belonging to the Baphometic Witch who created the blasphemous idol, and for thaumaturgical purposes is antithetical to Holy Water. This crucifix has had the honour of being kept both in the Vaults of the Vatican and in the reliquary of the Deathless Merchant of London. Using it for idolatry or invocation of Baphomet is at your own risk. The opening bid is four hundred thousand. Can I have four hundred thousand? I have four hundred thousand from #8. Thank you, Pandora. Can I have four hundred and twenty –” “Four hundred and twenty thousand!” “… four hundred and twenty thousand. Thank you, Professor Crowley. Can I have four hundred and forty thousand, please? Any bids for four hundred and forty thousand?” “Seems impractical, no?” Raubritter mused as quietly as he could, leaning as far away from Crowley as possible. “Only yields a few drops of blood at a time, yes? And if you hang it upside down, it does not work as art, I think. Too confusing to look at. Just blasphemy for the sake of blasphemy. Senselessly provocative. And again, with the Rabbinical alchemy in my veins, satanic powers are best avoided. I will pass on this, I think.” “Like I said; Rubbish. All of it,” Seneca replied, sneering slightly at his fellow patrons who seemed dead set on driving up the price of the ghoulish wall-hanging as close to a million dollars as it would go. As everyone else’s focus was devoted to Mothman, Seneca’s gaze drifted back to Halcyon. He had never been one to tolerate sass from a servant, even one that wasn’t his, but there was still something else about her that was eating away at him. Glaring at her with contempt, he racked his brain trying to figure out what it was about her he instinctively despised so much. She noticed him staring at her, and responded with a smug and sinister smirk before she began softly mouthing words at him. “Red Ruck, run amok, crowned the Regent Red. Eyes aflame, soul untamed, come join me in my bed!” Seneca didn’t bother to decipher what she was saying after the first two words. The Dream Demon Red Ruck was a thoughtform that had been torturing him in his sleep for nearly three years now, his punishment from the Ophion Occult Order for failing to contain Emrys. The instant Halcyon mouthed his name, Seneca knew why he had so immediately despised her. She, and likely Emma as well, were followers of the Regent Red. He nearly jolted straight out of his seat then, ready to unveil their secret and demand that Mothman throw them out for dabbling with forces well beyond their ken. But the sickeningly familiar melody of a flute robbed him of all courage and froze his heart solid. The auction house immediately fell silent, everyone turning every which way to locate the source of the intrusively whimsical sound, eventually spotting Red Ruck sitting in the rafters above Seneca. Ruck was a muscular, horned demon of large but not superhuman stature, spun out of dark and wispy shadows, the only colour he possessed being a pair of red embers glowing menacingly in his eye sockets. Many of the attending guests recognized him by reputation, but most still seemed surprised and bewildered at his uninvoked presence in the waking world. “Ah! It, ah, seems we have a late-comer to the auction. Welcome, Regent! Welcome!” Mothman said with a nervous laugh, stepping out from the podium and tentatively approaching the rafter where Ruck sat. “My apologies for not having extended an invitation. I had no idea you were interested in such temporal affairs. You are of course welcome to attend! If Your Regency would see it fit to come down to our level, we’ll find you a proper seat.” Ruck ceased playing his flute, and looked down at Mothman with a wide and menacing smile. “Come down? But then I’d land right on poor old Seneca’s head, wouldn’t I?” he asked, flexing the talons on his feet. “You… you have no right to be here!” Seneca shouted, forcing his trembling form from his seat and stumbling back towards the stage. “You have no right to walk the waking world! None, you hear me! You Egregore, you tulpa, you made up thing! Begone, back to the noosphere that birthed you, or I will exorcise you into the mind of a brain-dead invalid for the rest of their natural life!” Ruck glared at him stoically for a moment, before turning his head back towards Mothman. “Are you going to let him speak that way to your ‘welcomed guest’, Meremoth?” he asked. “Yes, that’s hardly any way to speak to a Regent, Mister Chamberlin,” Halcyon agreed. “Are you saying that a brain in a vat and an undead Kosher Nazi have more of a right to be here than Ruck does?” “I am not Nazi, I am Prussian!” Raubritter objected. “And I am not Kosher, I am cursed!” “You! You did this! You summoned him here!” Seneca spat. “Mothman, I saw her mutter his name! She lied! She’s one of his followers! They both are!” “Excuse me? You just said that Ruck was made up,” Halcyon retorted. “He’s my imaginary boyfriend; who lives in Canada. I was under no obligation to mention him to anybody.” In a rage, Seneca lunged at her, hand poised to backhand her across the face. Unflinching, Halcyon manifested a scourge made of the same shadowy dream nether as Ruck himself, and mercilessly whipped all seven lashes across his face. The force and shock of the blow were enough to send Seneca tumbling to the floor. In a panic, he reached up and felt his stinging cheek. The scourge was real enough to draw blood, it seemed. Before he could get up, Ruck leapt down upon him from the rafter and pinned him down with his clawed foot, the weight of his netherous form making it difficult to breathe. “If you ever, ever, try to harm either of them again, you will not wake up from your next nightmare with me!” he growled, knocking the top hat off his head. “That goes for everyone here and everyone else in the Order! These girls are my disciples and under my protection! Is that understood?” “Regent, I assure you that no one here other than Chamberlin has done anything unbecoming of an Adderman against either of these girls,” Mothman insisted, his hands raised in a position of surrender. “I’d be happy to escort him out of here myself for his brutish attack on Miss Halcyon, if you could see fit to remove your foot from his chest.” Ruck chuckled softly, and replied with a sadistic shake of his head. “Alas, my issues with this coward tonight go beyond his indiscretions against my fearsome Halcy,” he announced. “He’s tried to have me murdered, for no other reason than carrying out his justly decreed punishment. He’s gone and offered me up to Emrys as a sacrifice!” “Goddammit, Samantha!” Seneca cursed under his breath. “Now don’t go blaming the Hedge Witch for her lack of discretion,” Ruck chastised him. “She’s been posting accounts of her escapades on that antiquated forum for years; nobody reads them, least of all me. No, Seneca, I saw in your heart what you intended to do long before you ever spoke a word of your plan aloud, and you were a fool to think I hadn’t. For once in your pathetic life, take responsibility for your own failure! You failed to overcome your own fears, and instead sought to rid yourself of them! I am here tonight to show you, in front of dozens of witnesses so that there can be no doubt to the reality of it, that you are not safe from me in the waking world! That the nightmare doesn’t end when you wake up!” There was an enormous thunderclap, so loud it shook the building like a small earthquake. The lights went out, replaced by a dull crimson radiance that bathed the room from all sides without any apparent source. The rats that Halcyon and Emma had kept safely tucked away until then came scampering out, though already cloaked in their netherous dream forms so as not to be recognized. They instead resembled beaked bats or membrane-winged crows, climbing along their mistresses like baby dragons. As some of the guests made for the door, Halcyon sent a pair of flying rats to cut them off with a single pointed command. Crossing the room in a heartbeat, they slammed into the opened doors and forced them shut. Though they crashed to the ground, they righted themselves in an instant, and as the fear in the room rapidly grew, so did they. Now the size of dogs, more of the nightmare creatures formed a perimeter around the room. Circling the crowd as they flew through the air, the swarm herded the guests into the center, hissing and snapping at any who tried to escape. “How – how are you doing this?” Seneca stammered in terrified disbelief. “How are you bringing your nightmare creations into the waking world?” “You don’t need to know how, Seneca. You only need to know that I can,” Ruck smiled. Raising his clenched fist into the air, he imploded the glass of the windows inwards, revealing a forest of charred trees and crimson fog on the other side. “Regent, please! I accept that Seneca has done you wrong and you have a right to visit your penance upon him, but I implore you to have mercy upon us and my property!” Mothman pleaded, wiping shards of glass off his coat. “Very well. I suppose I’ve made my point,” Ruck conceded, lifting his foot off of Seneca. He began to scramble back up, but before he could get to his feet a pair of the winged creatures swooped down and snatched him up in their talons, pulling him screaming through the broken window and into the forest beyond. Halcyon and Emma hopped onto two other members of the swarm as they all gave chase, with Ruck himself bringing up the rear. “Be sure you pay both of them for the full night, you hear me Mothman?” he shouted over his shoulder as he vanished out the window. “I’m sure you’ll agree that such a pittance isn’t worth losing any sleep over!” The rats carrying Seneca flew him up to the highest tree in the forest and unceremoniously tossed him into it. He desperately wrapped his limbs around its crown as it swayed back and forth with the force of his impact, clinging for dear life as it threatened to toss him off. The entire swarm besieged him now, cawing like they had come across a feast of fresh carrion, and were only waiting for the wolves to join them. Sure enough, Seneca heard the familiar howling from his nightmares in the distance. He tried to see how close they were, but the red mist made it impossible. It made little difference, as they would be there all too soon. “Ruck! Ruck! I’m sorry! I’m sorry I offered you to Emrys!” he cried out. “End this, and we can work something out. I’ll get you anything you want! Anything I –” “Stop begging!” Ruck shouted into his face as he perched onto the opposite side of the crown. “Stop bargaining! Even with your life actually on the line, you’re still too pathetic to fight back!” “How am I supposed to fight off dream forms in the waking world!” Seneca demanded. “Halcyon did it!” Ruck shouted back. “A mortal girl not even one-tenth your age, with none of your skill or knowledge of the occult, fended off and then tamed the creatures that hunt you now! You have no excuse, Seneca! I weary of your cowardice. This is your last chance, you hear me? If you do not fend off the wolves this time, it’s your real body that will be torn to shreds. You fight, or you die.” With one hand, Ruck grabbed Seneca by the shirt and tore him from the tree, tossing him to the ground. One of the flying creatures caught him by his jacket and slowed him down just enough so that he didn’t break anything on impact. As he slowly raised his head, a sword landed upright mere inches from his face. “Your ceremonial serpentine sabre. You really should carry it on you rather than leaving it down in your ritual chamber,” Ruck chastised him. “These are dangerous times for the Order. You never know when you might need to defend yourself.” Seneca jumped to his feet and pulled the sword from the earth. Screaming, he swung it wildly as he charged towards Ruck, who effortlessly vanished into thin air before he was able to make contact. The seven demon-winged ravens above him broke out into a cacophony of cawing, the nearby wolves howling in return, so close now that Seneca could hear them crashing through the thicket. Terror-stricken though he was, he retained enough presence of mind to know that Ruck didn’t have the ability to cast living nightmares into the waking world unaided. The ravens above him, and the wolves closing in around him must have some type of physical body to support their dream forms. There must be some type of living creature hidden beneath the nether, and that was what he was actually fighting. More importantly, that was something he could actually fight. Holding the base of his blade up to his mouth, he exhaled upon the cold steel, and then rapidly sketched a crude sigil in his condensed breath. The enchantment was meant to compel the blade to seek for the heart of his enemy, wherever it may be. When he lowered his sword, he saw the first of the wolves standing before him. It was a meter high at the shoulder, but the raised ground it stood upon put it at eye level with Seneca, making it seem far bigger. It snarled at him, baring a mouthful of shadowy black fangs before pouncing, ready to tear out his throat. Seneca did not withdraw, but instead bolted forward, plunging the sabre straight into the wolf’s gaping maw and down its vacuous gullet. He felt the blade veer slightly off course of its own accord, impaling something soft and squishy. The wolf yelped in pain before instantly falling slack, the bright red glow of its eyes snuffing out like candles. At first, Seneca thought that he must have pierced the wolf’s heart, but as he watched the nightmare form dissipate, what he found skewered at the end of his sword was a large, black rat; still squirming and squealing with life in spite of the blade running through it. “No!” he heard Halcyon shout from above. The rest of the wolf pack skidded to a stop, suddenly reluctant to come any closer, while the ravens shrieked in outrage at the maiming. “Rats?” Seneca murmured incredulously, holding the struggling rat up to his face in morbid curiosity, utterly bewildered as to how it was still alive. “They’re all just rats?” Laughing in triumph, Seneca pressed his advantage. Charging forward with his sword and his victim held out on full display, the rest of the pack abandoned their dream forms as well, taking advantage of the cover the clouds of nether gave them to scurry out of sight into the undergrowth. “Satisfied, Ruck?” Seneca screamed to the trees around him. “You and your minions might be indestructible in a dream world of your own making, but once you set foot in the real world you are Regent of nothing, you hear me? Nothing! Your girls and your rats are subject to the same natural laws and physical limits as anyone else, and I’ll not hesitate to do to them what I’ve done to this blighter here if you ever try something like this again!” Heedless of his threat, Halcyon leapt down from her mount, her scourge raised in heated anger as she moved to strike. “No!” Ruck shouted, materializing behind her and holding her back. “It’s over! Seneca, it’s over. You’ve met my terms; you’ve won. Congratulations. Hand the rat over to Halcy, and we’ll be on our way.” Seneca laughed cruelly, for he realized that he had just stumbled upon a powerful bargaining chip with the Red Regent, one he wasn’t about ­­let go to waste. “It’s all over, Ruck! You want this furball back? Then swear on the River Styx to never again haunt my dreams; to never enter my mind, abduct me to your realm, or attack me in the waking world.” “I… I swear on the River Styx, that if you return that rat to us, the Nightmare Realm and its subjects will never trouble you again,” Ruck sighed. “You swear on the River Styx to forsake your duty to the Grand Adderman in releasing me from my punishment without his assent?” Seneca asked in delight as he gently pulled the writhing rat off of his sword. “That’s almost as good as feeding you to Emrys, Ruck, and if it means I’m rid of you, I’ll gladly take it.” He tossed the rat towards Halcyon, who dropped the scourge and caught the rat like it was a cherished kitten. Cradling it to her chest, she spun around and ran away from Seneca as fast as she could, with Emma dropping to the ground and chasing after her. As they vanished from sight, the vision of the Nightmare Realm began to dissipate as well, revealing the reality of Midsummer in Sombermorey that Seneca knew it to be. Ruck, through sheer force of will, retained his presence for a bit longer, snarling and shaking his head at Seneca until eventually vanishing as well. Exhaling with relief that his ordeal was finally over, Seneca pulled out a neckerchief and wiped the blade of his sabre clean, intending to have it analyzed to see precisely what Ruck had done to those rats. But that could wait. For the first night in a long time, Seneca was finally going to get a good night’s sleep. Written by The Vesper's Bell Content is available under CC BY-SA"}

No matter how hard I tried", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Reddit Pastas", "Computers and Internet", "Mental Illness", "NSFW"], "content": "I often browse through /r/gonewild. I like girls in addition to liking guys. Girls are different though. They’re beautiful creatures that deserve to be appreciated and respected. I don’t like the way guys talk to girls on there. I know that the girls like it, but they can do better than that. Talk like that often leads somewhere they may not like. A friend of mine saw me perusing through the pages of nude girls and her face went white. I asked her what was wrong and she told me a seriously disturbing story. In her words, this is it: About a year ago, I was dumped by a guy after a short month. He was the fifth in only six months. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make anyone fall in love with me. I couldn't make a relationship last more than a month. I was depressed. I found myself browsing porn sites, wishing I looked like those girls. Those were the types of girls guys wanted. I almost wished I enjoyed giving head or getting fucked in the ass, but I didn't. By accident, I discovered reddit and, not long after, /r/gonewild. At first, I only looked. I envied. I wished I could have that attention. I craved it. I decided that was what I wanted. I could be whoever I wanted to be. My first post wasn't all that wild, really. I used my elbows to squeeze my breasts together and, at the same time, hiding my nipples. However, the responses were overwhelming. Guys begged to see more of me. I made them wait. It was a whole week before my second post. I felt like I had been looking forward to it though. It was a bit more wild: a picture in pink lingerie. They asked me to show more skin. They called me beautiful and listed in detail things they wanted to do to my body. I couldn't wait a whole week this time. My third post was only two days later. A shot of my uncovered breasts. They all said such dirty things. I didn't really like all that dirty talk, but the character I made for myself, Karina, she did. I played this character and talked dirty right back. The very next day, I posted a full body nude. That was the first time he commented. He said: “Someone so gorgeous deserves someone worthy of her.” It stood out because it wasn't a dirty comment. It was sweet and innocent. I thanked him. The day after, I did my first album. I included a few shots of my boobs, my butt, and some of me caressing myself. Of course, they loved them all. Upvotes galore. I was almost famous, it seemed. All of it was going to my head. I was getting overconfident. I started taking shots almost everywhere I went. I would take them in public bathrooms, dressing rooms, and do up-skirt shots in restaurants and on park benches. Honestly, I was a bit out of control. He commented on all of them. He never said anything offensive. He was polite, yet he was on that subreddit for the same reason as the others. I received a private message from him after about a month of posting. It read: “I would love you if you were mine.” I wasn't sure what to say, but I didn't want to be rude. He was giving me the attention I wanted anyways. I replied with: “You wouldn't if you knew me.” His reply was strange, but I thought nothing of it. “But I do know you.” I laughed it off. “I meant in real life.” His reply was a link to a picture. I clicked it and my heart stopped. It was me at the mall, looking through lingerie. How did I not notice someone watching me? I wanted to call the cops, but I felt as though I’d brought it on myself by posting on the internet. He sent me another message. It made my skin crawl. “I want you to wear that pretty red lingerie for me when I fuck you.” He knew what I bought. I hadn't posted a picture in that yet. I felt sick. I logged off immediately. I wasn't sure what to do. I couldn't tell anyone. I didn't want anyone to know I’d been posting my nudes all over the internet for attention. I decided that I could delete my account. He didn't know where I lived. He just knew I went to that mall from my other pictures. If you were a local, it was easy to recognize. I logged back in. There was another message waiting for me. It was another link. I didn't want to click, but I needed to know what it was. I wish now that I hadn't. It was me sitting in class at my college. It was taken through the little glass window on the door. I was taking notes. I never even noticed. How long had he been watching me? I needed to find out how he found me. I must have left some clue in my pictures. I went though them, one by one. I couldn't find anything. Then, I saw it. In every picture, on my right hand, my class ring. He knew what college I went to because of my class ring. I wondered if he was also a student. What if he was near me all the time without me knowing? I deleted my account. I took all my pictures off imgur. I stayed home from school the next day. I was afraid to leave my house. Around four that afternoon, I received a Facebook message from a girl named Charlotte. I don’t remember adding her as a friend, but I must have. I click on her profile before reading her message. I know her from class. Relief floods through me. Her message asked if I would like to join her study group and that, if I was interested, they were meeting after school at the coffee shop just off campus. I needed to learn what I had missed during my absence, so I agreed and said I would see her after class. The next day, I waited at the coffee shop. I ordered a mocha and sat in the corner. I didn't want to draw too much attention to myself since I was alone. I pulled out my laptop and got on Facebook while I waited. I wondered if maybe Charlotte had canceled the study session. No new messages from her though. I had an uneasy feeling. I went back to her profile and noticed something I should have noticed before. I was her only friend. She had no recent post history. She only had one photo. I slammed my laptop shut, threw my coffee away, and left immediately. I felt like someone was following me. I glanced around, paranoid. I couldn't go home. I didn't know if they might be waiting for that so that they knew where I lived. What if they already knew? I was scared. I started crying. A man approached me and asked if I was alright. He touched my arm gently. I flinched away like I was burned and ran. I went into a store to hide. I watched the door, terrified it would open and my stalker would find me. That’s what he was at that point, a stalker. I didn't know who he was and that was the scariest part. He could be anyone. I started crying again. I couldn't leave the store. I sat down on one of the little benches for trying on shoes. I sat there until a lady told me they were closing and that I had to go. I stepped outside and it was dark. He could be waiting for me. I would have been safer in the day time. I panicked. I turned around and started yanking on the door. She had already locked it behind me. She was walking back to the register. I started banging on the door and screaming. I couldn't be alone. “Please, let me in! Let me back in!” I pounded on the glass repeatedly. “Please! Don’t leave me out here with him!” She came back. I was so grateful. She unlocked the door and let me back in, locking it again behind us. She then called the police. I lied to them. I had to lie. I didn't want them to know how stupid I had been. I said I met him on the internet and I had no clue how he knew where I lived. I told them about the fake Charlotte Facebook account and the pictures of myself he sent me. There wasn't anything they could do without proof and, since I deleted my reddit account, I didn't have anything except Facebook messages. I was a mess. They escorted me home and said they would have an officer on my block all night. I barely slept at all. The next day, I was afraid to leave my apartment. I received another message from fake Charlotte. It read: “I saw you at the coffee shop. Why did you leave?” I strained my mind, struggling to remember the people in the coffee shop around me, but the truth was, none of them stood out. They were just regular people. My stalker looked normal. If he had been wearing a bright purple top hat with a matching suit and held a giant sign that read “I’M STALKING YOU”, maybe I’d have noticed, and still just maybe. The truth is, I’m almost always unaware of the things around me. My stalker was right there and I couldn't tell. I contacted the police department and told them about the new message. They took note of it and said the officer would be on my block again that night to keep me safe. What about during the day though? How was I supposed to go outside? I blocked the fake Facebook account and made sure all my doors were locked. I closed my blinds in every room and turned on all the lights. I ate ramen noodles and watched Netflix. I fell asleep on my couch. I was awoken by the text buzzing of my phone. It was from a strange number. I opened it. “I like Clueless too.” I covered my mouth to stifle a sob. That was the movie I had been watching when I had fallen asleep. I called 911 and told them someone was in my house. The officer on my block knocked on my door just a minute later. I showed him the text and told him I thought the guy was in my house. He searched the house, gun drawn and found nothing. No sign of forced entry on any of the doors or windows. However, he did discover that you could see my TV clearly through my blinds. They tried to track the number, but it was a TextFree account and the name and email address it was connected to turned up nothing. He knew where I lived. I wanted to leave and go stay with a friend, but I knew he would just follow me. Instead, I invited my older brother to stay at my house for a few days. I told him about what was going on and pleaded that he stay to protect me. After hearing my story, he decided he would stay until they caught the guy. My brother lived nearby, so it wasn't a big deal. However, he still had to leave me to go to work. During those hours, I paced, constantly peering out the windows and jumping at the slightest noise. When my brother, Sean, was home, I stayed in the same room at all times. I made him take me grocery shopping. I couldn't go alone. I stopped going to school. I needed someone to catch this guy. For the first few days Sean stayed, I heard nothing from my tormentor. I was relieved, but at the same time, it felt like the calm before the storm. On the fourth day, I got a text from a different number than before. “7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday”. It was Sean’s work schedule. He knew when I would be alone. I sunk down against the counter, sobbing. It was 12 p.m. on a Saturday. He had six more hours before Sean got home. I phoned the cops. They tried tracking the number again, but same as before, nothing. I contemplated suicide. My hair was falling out. I couldn't sleep. I had chewed my nails down until they bled. Weeks went by. I received text after text, all from different numbers. They all told me he was watching. At some point, I decided I couldn't be a victim anymore. I had my brother go with me to get a gun license. I bought a Ruger Compact Pistol. I spent a lot of money I didn't have on that gun and went to a shooting range to learn how to use it. He wasn't going to fuck with me anymore. Sean offered to take off work to stay and watch over me, but I refused. Instead, after he left, I went out. I wanted to bait my stalker. I needed to know who he was. I needed him to slip up and reveal himself accidentally. So, I went out window shopping. I flipped through racks of clothes and tried on shoes. I watched the people around me, but I didn't notice anyone watching and I didn't see anyone twice. I didn't receive any texts. It was like he knew I was trying to catch him. He stopped for a week. I started going back to school. My first day back, he sent me a picture of myself at my desk. Again, it was through the glass window in the door. My head snapped to the right. He was already gone. I excused myself from class. When I got out in the hall, I didn't know which way he had gone. I didn't know what he looked like. I had left my gun in my car. I couldn't take it in the school. It was hidden under my seat. I felt a lot less brave without it. I weighed my stalker’s options. Left led to the lunch quarters and right led out to the main office and visitor parking. Assuming he wasn't a student, I went right. I ran. I reached the parking lot and saw a car leaving. I didn't know that it was my stalker, but I memorized the license plate and saved it in my phone. After that, I went to the front office and asked to speak with security personnel. A balding, overweight man who fit the donut stereotype spoke with me. I told him about my situation and asked him if I could see the security footage from the time that I was in class and received the photo. He allowed me to see it. During the moment I received the photo, he was already gone, but before that, a guy in a black hoodie watched through the window for nearly ten minutes before snapping the photo. It was sent a few minutes later after he’d already gone. I felt defeated. He was smarter than I thought. The car I saw pulling out couldn't have been him. I asked him to play the footage from when he was coming down the hall, when he would be facing the cameras. He kept his head low, but I could see he was white with dark hair. I couldn't see much more than that. I had the security guy send it over to the police. They were able to determine his height and guess his weight. They put him at 6’4” and around 200 lbs. They put pictures of him and the only information they had on flyers and had them tacked all around the college. The urged anyone who had seen him to call. They received a few calls. Someone had seen his face. His description was put out on the news. I felt better than I had in weeks. I finally had him. They were going to get him. That night, I got a call. It was panting and grunting. It sounded like someone jacking off over the phone. I was pretty sickened and hung up. I got another text. “I’m going to fuck you before they get me.” I didn't answer as always, but this time, he kept going. “I love those little black panties you’re wearing.” I was wearing black panties. I was frozen with fear. “You know that sexy little yellow dress in your closet?” “It smells nice.” I bolted out of the room and grabbed my purse, whipping out the gun. I fumbled to turn off the safety. He was in my closet. I went back to my room and ripped open the closet door and fired. I managed to blow a hole in the back of my closet wall as well as make my ears ring worse than I thought possible. I had another text. “Nope, not in there. I hope the panties I took aren't your favorite. You left them in the bathroom floor.” He was in my house. He had taken my underwear. He had been in my closet. I hadn't been able to do anything. I updated the cops and they tried again to track the number. I knew they wouldn't find anything, so I changed mine. I would no longer know he was watching me. I can’t say which is worse, knowing or not knowing. Since he couldn't text me, he would have to find another way to contact me. And he did. He started another Facebook account. This time it was a guy named Chance. Someone also from class. “You’re cute. I was wondering if maybe you’d like to go out for drinks sometime?” I knew it wasn't Chance. Chance was gay. But I sent back: “I would love to. What place did you have in mind?” He told me to meet him at a bar on the North side of town. It was an old bar and it didn't get a lot of business. There would probably be no one there. I told my brother and he let the police know, just so my stalker wouldn't see me communicating with the police. I made a show out of getting ready for my “date.” I got ready in my room, where I already knew he could see though my blinds. I wore the yellow dress. My heart was beating way too fast. Sean told me that the police would be watching and not to worry. I drove to the bar and stood outside in my yellow dress. I was a bright splotch in the darkness. I could barely breathe. A car pulled up next to mine. It was a shitty navy blue Ford Probe. I waited, holding my breath. No one got out. At the last second, he reversed and peeled out of there pretty fast. The undercover cop parked across the street sped after him. They caught him. Do you know who tortured me all that time? Do you know who ruined my life all because of some naked pictures on the internet? A fucking kid. He was a sixteen year old dropout who spent all his time fapping to his computer screen. When he saw my class ring and realized I was so close, he became obsessed with having the real thing. I still have nightmares because this fucked up little brat couldn't get some. This is a warning to you, girls of /r/gonewild, watch what you put in your pictures. Be wary of everyone. Don’t lead anyone on and, if someone starts harassing you, don’t wait to tell someone. Protect yourself and your identity. NEVER show your face in a post or give out your location, phone number, etc. You don’t want to go through what I did. Credited to OwlBeThere"}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Memory", "title": "Untitled", "author": "myself", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Historical Archive", "Beings", "Dreams/Sleep"], "content": "When thinking back to my earliest memories, nothing is concrete. A string of hazy images come to mind like random snapshots out of time, each one associated with certain feelings and emotions. They are imbued with a mystical dreamlike quality, a gift born of childhood naivety. The magic of every Christmas when Santa was still real, for example, is an experience of pure joy that is lost with maturity. Many of these snapshots are impossible to place in any sort of context. They’re just… there, sunken in the crevices of the brain without rhyme or reason: playing with my dad’s beard in a wood-paneled room, him smiling down at me – comforting. Or discovering a long row of marching ants in someone’s wooded backyard, all by myself – exciting. Some of them don’t even seem real in hindsight. Did I actually fall from that tree by the lake, only to land on my feet without a scratch? Was it really a dream? I don’t think so. Sure, I have memories of distant dreams, but there is a clear distinction between the dreams and reality of my past. I don’t know how I can tell, I just can. And for this reason one memory has always troubled me. The experience was so surreal, and yet certain details stand out with marked clarity. I’m not exactly sure when it happened. I couldn't have been older than five or six. My brother and I were sleeping in our bunk bed. Because he was older, he got the top bunk. I had just woken up, but it was still nighttime. Something felt different. I remember seeing and smelling the rain, but not hearing any. The window was open and it was very cold in the room. Why was the window open? The curtains were gently flapping but there was no breeze. The quiet was so intense it buzzed through my ears. I’d been lying on my side, with one arm dangling off the edge of the bed. Gradually I became aware that it was warmer near the floor. I felt some kind of heated breeze gently strike my hand, coming and going in short bursts. Finally I recognized it as someone’s breathing. Then the woman slid out from under my bed. The nightlight showed that she had long blondish hair and wore a white nightgown, and in the dimness I thought it was my mother. I wasn't at all scared. It’s funny how a child’s mind works. What’s mommy doing under the bed? Must be getting something, or checking for monsters. I was too tired to say anything and remained motionless, watching. The woman was on her back, but her face stayed in the shadows. She rolled over and crawled on all fours to the far end of the bed, then glided up the ladder to the top bunk. Her every movement was silky smooth and completely silent. She reminded me of a white ribbon dancing in the wind. I closed my eyes and fell back to sleep. I also remember my brother telling me about a weird dream the next morning. He’d dreamt of a woman who lived “under the floor” and came out at night to play in the rain. When her clothes got soaked, she went back inside and would whisper things to anyone who was sleeping. It became a recurring dream for him until our family moved out of that house. Strange, what the brain chooses to remember. Credited to alapanamo"}

There was no additional information provided with the email, nor was the email affixed with any identifying information. Question: How do you let people know about something great you've done, if doing so will get you in trouble? Answer: Jackson broke his arm at the playground today. It was a compound fracture, both bones probably broken but only the radial compounded. He fell off the monkey bars. He's fallen off before, so have I. But this time it was different, he fell on his arm at the perfect angle. I stood over him, watching him bleed, watching his face turn white and his eyes roll back into his head. He screamed at first, but there's always screaming so none of the teachers even noticed him. His blood mixed with the woodchips beneath him, turning them red. I had an urge to touch it, to see if it was real, like mine. But I didn't want to dirty my clothes. This isn't the first time I've seen someone else hurt, but this was by far the worst injury I've ever seen. I don't know why it fascinates me to see them in pain. I often wonder if they are pretending it hurts. Logically it doesn't make sense, but it's hard to imagine anything else. They just aren't as real as me. Which is an excellent segue to my next point. Dr. \"Steve,\" who, for reasons known only to himself, believes me incapable of pronouncing his real surname Streibach, has not gotten any closer to diagnosing me. He still believes I lie on the autism scale and might have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or possibly Oppositional Defiance Disorder. I enjoying playing games with him. Sometimes I'll close the door to his office an odd number of times, counting, other times I leave it slightly ajar, as if I forgot altogether to close it. It's very funny to watch him scribble notes about it. While Streibach continues to muddle about in his own staggering incompetence, I may have discovered the root of my, shall we say, grandness. It happened quite by accident. I wandered into the biography section of the public library during \"Story time.\" There I found a book about a man named Theodore Bundy, a famous serial killer active in the 1970's. I found his story fascinating, especially the description of his murders. Like me he found it difficult to relate to others, and couldn't understand why people would seek out friendships. The book described him as a textbook sociopath. I did further research and believe I too am a sociopath. I will continue operating under this assumption until I find a better diagnosis. In the new year I will begin adding the year in the date of my entries, I didn't think to keep this up for more than a year, but it's important a record of my existence be minutely detailed and as extensive as possible. I know I am great, and destined for great things. I want the world to see my greatness. It was an exceedingly wise decision to keep two separate journals. Mother no longer asks what I'm writing, as I often leave the decoy journal open or unlocked. I've been copying the entries from a site online and changing the names and dates to fit my life. I want my parents to leave me alone and yet I crave their attention. I don't know why. I don't know if this is normal or if I want it to be normal. This portion of my daily writing relates to the entry on November the 29th. As I mentioned earlier, we have mice. This is no doubt due to my stupid younger sister, Samantha's inability to get food in her mouth. When I was 18 months old I could eat perfectly well. But I digress. We have mice, and after much cajoling, screaming, begging and tantrums, I managed to convince my parents to use \"humane\" mouse traps, i.e. traps which merely capture the mouse alive as opposed to killing it. They actually thought it was promising, assuming that I was somehow troubled by the prospect of killing the mouse. The truth, of course, is that I wanted to experiment on the mouse. As I have mentioned in several entries, I desire to be a scientist, probably in biological sciences. My idol was Louis Pastuer, though that may be changing, as I will explain below. A mouse was caught in a trap under the basement steps. I found him before Father got home and stole away with him to my room. I want to know if his pain is real, or if it's something pretend. I've designed an experiment to do this and am excited to begin first thing tomorrow. Dr. Streibach wants me to sit through another I.Q. test. He thinks I \"gamed\" the last one. He asked me about it during my session today. He said, \"Richard, why didn't you try your hardest on the test I gave you last month?\" I told him, \"I did, Dr. Steve. It was really hard.\" \"I know you're smarter than this test shows. I want to talk about the letter C today,\" he said. I almost laughed. I didn't want to score too well on the test so I began marking the letter C for questions for which I knew C was not the proper answer. It was just a distraction during the otherwise boring test. He must have noticed that most, if not all, of the wrong answers were C's and that I rarely, if ever, got a question wrong if the answer was in fact C. It took me a few moments to figure out how to turn this to my advantage. I decided to play obsessive compulsive today, though I'd left the door open. \"I knew C wasn't the right answer on some Dr. Steve,\" I said trying to sound ashamed. For some reason they like it when you sound ashamed, as if they enjoy other people's pain or discomfort. (Note: Experiment with this in Mother or Father. See if they enjoy seeing me in physical pain, then see if they prefer to see me sad.) \"I just felt like something bad would happen if I didn't mark C.\" \"But you didn't mark all of the answers C,\" Dr. Streibach observed. \"I didn't always feel like something bad would happen,\" I replied. He was scribbling furiously. \"Why did you sometimes feel like something bad would happen and sometimes didn't? What was different between these questions?\" I shrugged and watched Dr. Streibach's expression change. The emotion, unless I've guessed wrong, was \"crestfallen.\" I've observed it on Mother's face when she gets a bad report from my teachers after a few weeks of good reports. I don't think I can emulate it yet, but soon I may be able to. I will continue to try and produce it in those around me. I also continued an experiment I began yesterday shortly after writing in my secret journal. I asked people who Ted Bundy was, as \"Ted\" is the more familiar name for Theodore Bundy whom I mentioned above. Additionally, I asked them who Louis Pastuer was. I was surprised to learn that almost every adult knew exactly who Mr. Bundy was, but only a handful knew Louis Pastuer. It is no exaggeration to say Dr. Pastuer saved millions of lives with his breakthroughs. Mr. Bundy on the other hand killed less than one hundred people; and yet people see him as the greater man. With this discovery in mind, I no longer consider Dr. Pastuer my idol and instead believe Theodore Bundy is the man more worthy of my esteem. His fame does not arise from anything other than the gruesome nature of his crimes. Further, I am intrigued by the idea of Mr. Bundy's exploits because I find the idea of pain in others fascinating. Though, I still very much would like to be a scientist. PS: I heard my parents having sex last night. It made me angry because I don't want another sibling. Samantha is bad enough as it is. I was unable to write yesterday as I was too busy with my experiment. The mouse, which I named Samantha, for obvious reasons, was an interesting subject. I was not aware until yesterday that they could vocalize. Samantha vocalized extensively, much like the real Samantha, however, I found mouse Samantha's vocalization more pleasing as I controlled it. I won't go into minute details of my experiment (I've entered them into a \"Lab Notebook\" hidden in the usual place), but suffice it to say it was extremely insightful and enjoyable. It makes me wonder how different a mouse is from a person. I briefly fantasized about Samantha the baby while experimenting on Samantha the mouse. Would she make the same noise if poked with a needle? I imagine she would to some degree. I have another meeting tomorrow with Dr. Streibach, he increased our sessions to twice a week after our discussion on Tuesday, December the 6th, regarding my chosing C answers. It's yet another annoyance I have to suffer through, though I do enjoy his interest in me. I think some day even his bumbling notes will be in a museum, as documentation of my greatness. My teacher, Ms. Stevens (how ironic) and my parents are discussing whether or not I should advance to Seventh Grade early. Normally I wouldn't care, but a new girl began in my class today, she's a transfer student. Something about her interests me. Her name is Katherine I spoke with her on the playground. She was very nice to me when we spoke of her but didn't want to hear anything about me. She knew who Mr. Bundy was and, like me, was interested in him. She got in trouble for drumming on her desk. She stopped when she got caught and didn't start again. She's not like the other kids in class. I haven't written anything for several days because I've been so busy. First and foremost, Katherine continues to intrigue me. I spent Saturday and part of Sunday \"playing\" at her parents' home in Hidden Meadow Estates, the housing development four miles north of my home. It's a nicer neighborhood than mine, and her house is bigger than mine. She doesn't have any siblings and her parents aren't asian, though she is. She's like me, but still less real. I will explain how I discovered this. At her house she showed me to her room. She showed me her books of which she pretended to be very proud. I asked which was her favorite. She paused and looked at me. It was the look Dr. Streibach sometimes gives me, a calculating look. Our eyes met and she smiled. \"You know I've never read them. How?\" she asked conversationally. I tapped the binding of the nearest book on the shelf. \"The spines aren't cracked. They've never been opened.\" \"Would you like to see my favorite book, Richard?\" \"Sure, that'd be cool,\" I replied. She went to her bed and pushed the mattress over a small ways exposing the boxspring. There was a cut in the cover of the boxspring which could have been an incidental tear but wasn't. She fished inside and pulled out a thick book entitled \"Anatomy of the Human Body,\" the author's name was Henry Gray. I have heard of it before, Dr. Streibach has a copy on his shelf, but I never thought to look in it. It was glorious. The engravings were beautiful, the renditions of human organs superb. It was so much better than disecting Samantha the mouse. \"Do you like it Alfred?\" she asked me. I tried to hide my excitement. \"I don't know, it's kinda cool I guess.\" \"Drop the act Alfred,\" she said smiling. \"I'm not quite so blind or foolish as your parents or Ms. Stevens. You're like me. That's why you asked about Theodore Bundy. By the way, everyone calls him Ted.\" I might have kept up the act but I could see it was pointless. She stood staring at me, hands on her hips, waiting, calculating. \"I think a man of such esteem deserves the full measure of my respect.\" \"Then perhaps you should address him by his given name...\" \"Theodore Cowell,\" we said in unison. \"We're both intelligent, Alfred. It would be mutually beneficial to combine our intellect toward a common goal.\" \"What goal would that be?\" I asked. \"Greatness,\" she replied simply, and I knew it would be good for me to work with her. She showed me the pictures she'd taken of her own animal experiments. They were beautiful. She labled many of the organs and pinned open the subjects just like in the books I've read on discection. I told her how much I liked them and she touched my cheek and smiled. \"Do you have a psychologist or other mental health professional working with you?\" she asked as we sat on her bed thumbing through the pictures. \"I do,\" I replied pausing to look at an excellent picture of a cat's still beating heart. \"Has he a diagnosis for you?\" I smiled proudly. \"I've been toying with him. He currently thinks I'm OCD, that means...\" She waved her hand dismissively. \"I know what it means. I had one before we moved and will likely have another one. Mine came close, he was toying with the idea of labling me Reactive Attachment Disorder, but every time he wrote it in his pad he'd scribble it out again. He was a simpering idiot.\" She could read his writing by the way his pen moved. I couldn't do that. But I never tried either. She sat very close to me as we looked at the photographs. I felt strange, something I can't quite describe. Nervous and good. I wanted her to keep talking to me and being nice to me, but I don't know why. We spoke about Bundy, but she told me about other people. John Wayne Gacy, Ed Gein, Jeffery Dahmer, and a woman named Aileen Wurnos who Katherine both admired and despised at times. I told her that I wanted to do something great, so that people would know about me and how good I was. She echoed this sentiment and we agreed to do something great together. We will meet again tomorrow or the next day. She suggested we make a secret language to avoid detection and tell the other students that she is my girlfriend so people don't ask why we spend so much time together. I liked this idea, and the prospect of spending time with her. She likes to hear my ideas for great things to do. Katherine and I have decided upon a great thing to do. The idea came to us both at the same time like divine inspiration, perhaps it is fate. It all started yesterday when I was sitting down to eat dinner. Samantha sits across the table from me in her high chair, with Father at the head of the table to my right, and Mother at the foot of the table to my left. Mother was feeding Samantha, and neither her nor Father was paying attention to me as I tried to tell them about Katherine. I was becoming frustrated when Samantha knocked over her bowl hard enough to splatter me with her mashed peas. I grabbed a serving plate half filled with spiral cut ham and brandished it at her little pink skull. I paused, realizing that I would get caught and, wanting to avoid punishment, I set the plate down and sat back in my seat. Mother and Father looked at one another and wore expressions I couldn't identify. They discussed punishing me and eventually sent me to my room. I read a book Katherine had lent to me. The next day I told her what happened and she asked me to describe it in minute detail. She touched my leg as we sat on my bed. I was filled with the same indiscribable feeling as I mentioned in the entry dated December 12th. When I told her about holding up the platter and looking at Samantha's head she got visibly excited. The idea came to us then. Killing Samantha would be the first great thing we did. But that was merely the kernal of the plan, soon an entire scheme began to arise around that one idea. We each had much to contribute. Katherine decided that it would be best if she did the actual killing, as she had more experience with animals and she was less likely to be a suspect in a subsequent police investigation. I agreed and added that we should take Samantha out of the house to do it, that way we could experiment with her first. The plan, as it currently stands, is that I will lure Mother away from Samantha during her afternoon nap. Next, Katherine will sneak in the house, go up to Samantha's room and take her out of the house. She'll keep Samantha in a hidden place (an old shed I found in the woods last summer while exploring, see entry dated July the 11th). Katherine kissed me before she left, it was very enjoyable. I've begun putting together a \"kit\" for our plan. Just some instruments I want to use in our experiments with Samantha. It is essentially an expanded version of the tools I used on Samantha the mouse. My heart races just thinking about this first great deed in what I can only imagine will be many. We expect to put the plan into motion on December the 24th, as an early Christmas present to ourselves. I want Katherine to kiss me when we're done. Merry Christmas! It truly is a merry Christmas. Everything went off perfectly. I took copious notes in my Lab Notebook, Katherine took some great pictures and of course her work with the vivisection was beyond compare. I was astounded how long the subject remained conscious even as we tried a number of experiments. As much as I hated Samantha, I must say I'm glad I had a younger sister! As I had hoped, Katherine kissed me again shortly after we completed our experiments. The combined exhilaration of the act of our experiment combined with the pleasure of the kiss was almost overwhelming. Thus far, no suspicion has been cast upon either of us (ironically, the police questioned my father at length). It was difficult to act sad when my parents told me about Samantha's disappearance (still haven't found her!) I attribute my success to the hours Katherine and I spent practicing. My parents have been paying much more attention to me recently, although I'm not sure if they suspect I was involved or if they are just trying to comfort me. The best part about this Christmas is what my parents told me earlier today. Mother is pregnant. Before I met Katherine this would have seemed like a nightmare, but now that we are working together it's actually really exciting. With all the things we learned from Samantha, I can only imagine how informative it will be to experiment on a subject carrying a child!"}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Matter_of_Time", "title": "Untitled", "author": "their regret until their lives end", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Beings"], "content": "Author's note: So this is the first creepypasta I've ever written. I wrote this one in the middle of the night and I know it's not perfect. I would love any feedback and would be incredibly appreciative of advice from more experienced creepypasta authors who may read this story. Have you ever regretted something? Truly regretted it? Not some act of petty revenge or an embarrassing gaffe, but instead a mistake so tremendous that it stays with you throughout the remainder of your mortal coil, never granting you a moment of peace? Nearly everyone has experienced this type of regret. Some manage to go their entire lives silently enduring it whilst others snap; forever tormented by their regret until their lives end; by their own hand or otherwise. There is a third group; those so tormented by their regrets that ,in their desperation, they show a willingness to bypass all forms of earthly and supernatural law. I refer to this group of people as 'Empty's', for nothing exists within them at this point except for a desire to be rid of their regrets. Occasionally, one or two of these poor souls will, through instruction or sheer luck, gain access to a more 'unconventional' means of absolution. Have you heard of the String theory: a hypothesis proposing the existence of an infinite number universes, each one differentiated by a string of variables and events scattered across millennium of each universes existence? This theory is much closer to reality than what people suspect. Some souls manage to break the ancient seals of the earthly realm. Fueled by their selfish desire to rid themselves of their regret, they call upon ancient, unspeakable magics to erase their universe, its life, its achievements, and, of course, their own regrets along with it. Yet, this comes at a price. Although they may find comfort in another universe free of the regrets of their former; I can offer only my condolences to those who choose this path, for they condemn themselves to damnation in their inability to endure their fate attributed to them by their own universe and instead seek to tamper with the balance of the cosmos themselves to enjoy but a meager lifetime of comfort. That is where I come in. I am, for want of a better word, an 'adviser' or 'moralist' of sorts. The spirits beyond my control which facilitate the exchange between universes demand complete commitment from Empties, considering indecision a grave insult. Any indecision on the part of the Empty weakens the barrier between universes and The Void, the realm which lies beyond mortal comprehension, which even the spirits of time fear. Thus, in order to ensure whether or not an Empty is committed to their path, the Empty is made to live through both the best and worst moments of the lives. It is my duty to guide each of the Empty's through their memories, taking care not to lose them and leave them trapped in a never ending cycle of both their best and worst memories (it's happened a few times I must admit). Once this phase of the ritual is complete, the Empty is given a choice whether to continue in their pursuit of a new life or to accept their current one. If an Empty chooses to withdraw from the ritual, they will wake up at the location where they summoned the spirits of time but will be unable to remember doing so. They will live the rest of their lives with perfect memory, remembering always the best and worst times of both their past and future, a small price to pay for such a selfish whim. If an Empty chooses to continue with the ritual, then both I and the spirits are rendered powerless to stop them. Once a link has been forged between two universes, the gateway will be exposed to The Void and the timeless, ancient horrors which dwell within it. This is the most dangerous stage of the ritual. The Empty must not tarry as the denizens of the Void will seek to flood through the gateway into both universes. Partial contact with the Void is impossible to avoid during the crossing between universes as any prospective Empty WILL be exposed to the shadowy realm, if only for a moment. A moment is all that is required, however. Many Empty's have met their end during the crossing; falling prey to the creatures of the Void and being condemned to suffer an eternity of torment at the mercy of abominations which have existed since the dark beginnings of existence itself. Once a successful Empty completes the crossing, the forces of the Void will stream into the old universe, consuming it and all its inhabitants and claiming the universe for the Void. The Empty, however shall be safely warped to their new universe, starting their lives afresh from birth as they seek to remodel their old lives into one with no regrets. Ironically, all former Empty regret their decision by the end of their false life as, in punishment for their selfishness, their adopted universe collapses and they are left to the mercy of the creatures of the Void. These creatures do not take lightly to lesser beings who tamper with the natural order of time and existence and will relish each of scream of agony and torment and regret torn from the lungs of those who thought themselves worthy of altering the structure of time. In my duty of advising Empty's and protecting the true flow of time and fate, I have made a startling discovery. Over the eons of the various universes existence; prospective Empty's have gradually whittled away at the fragile barriers between the remaining universes and the Void. These barriers grow weaker still and I fear that it is but a matter of time before the sins of mankind are repaid with a reckoning and the hordes of the Void, now lying in wait as they bide their time. My greatest fear, however, is for myself, for the beasts of the Void, in their hatred of humanity, must detest and revile their creator even more so. I fear that I am powerless against such blind fury. Humanity has many flaws, but their worst is their fixation on their regrets. That is my greatest sin and my greatest regret; to have doomed humanity from the beginning. I know not what fate awaits humanity. And I know not what fate awaits me; a powerless god. It is only matter of time."}

Will I ever be free of this tormenting life after death? To exist as a ghost wandering around in my own despair, just longing to be put back to rest? I remember how peaceful the long rest was. There I was, sleeping in my ancient tomb without a thought to the living. Complete solitude. I was not being a bother to anyone living. But all of that was snatched from me, many years later. Everything I had in life, and even in death were all taken away. Gone. And I still don’t know why to this day, and I probably never will. Suddenly, the past came rushing back to me. I remembered who I was, yet still not why I was here. I never did any ill deed in my life. I was born a human, for Christ’s sakes! Not this, this… fiend! This creature, lurking through the night and mad with anguish as I gloss over everything I have lost! This legend of campfire tales and nightmare fuel, the scary stories that small boys tell in the dark! But all I have left is this damned mask that taunts me so. I can’t be separated from it. Everywhere I go, it trails behind me. Everywhere I turned; it would follow me like a long lost puppy. I passed by a graveyard, Lavender Town was its name, to be exact, or at least the town name. The cemetery did not really have one that anybody knew of. There were many rumors and hoaxes surrounding it. Stories of how the dead came back from life to haunt the living. The stories of buried corpses sucking victims in, or of ghastly hands clasping around the living. The most frightening of them all being a ghost, a devil granting its trainer immense power, just to take it away. But all I have to ask is, why? What sick, twisted monster would torture us so? I took out the mask, my mask... Except it was not always a mask, it was once my face. Hesitant, frail tears came to its eyes as I gazed upon it. My face... was once so beautiful... All I could do was stare at the mask, and weep silently to myself. I can never be free. Written by FlakyPorcupine Content is available under CC BY-SA"}
