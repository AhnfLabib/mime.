Then, not forgetting his parasol and his walking stick, he entered his old cottage. He carefully balanced his stick and his parasol in the closet, then walked into the kitchen. He put on the kettle, and as he did, Grimalkin purred as she leapt up near the kitchen sink. He gently stroked her black fur, as the kettle grew noisier. Then he remembered to feed her. “There’s a good puss… good girl…” he murmured. Once the kettle was singing, he poured himself some Earl Grey, gently blew over it, and then took a sip. “Let’s let Susie in the bedroom!” “No Susie can’t be there, it’s not her bedtime!” Just at that moment, Mother walked in, with a wide-eyed toddler beside her. “Girls?” she called out. “Gerald wants to play with you. Are you going to let him?” Annabel sighed. Not this again. Why couldn’t Gerald play with his own friends? “But Mummy! Gerald’s a boy! Boys can’t play with us!” Mother cooed. “Please… look at him. He loves his big sister. He desperately wants to play with you. Don’t you dear, Gerald?” Gerald looked really happy, but didn’t know how to express himself. “I don’t want to hear any arguing. Is that clear? Just let Gerald play with your dolls, and be nice to him.” Gerald toddled over to his older sister, and pointed to the house, which was almost bigger than he was. In an effort to get attention, he announced in front of Annabel and her friends, in as much English as he could, “It’s big!” Annabel’s friends were beginning to feel sorry for him. “Come over here, Gerald, help Susan get dressed for her day at school.” “No! Wendy! Gerald can’t play with dolls! Don’t let him touch her!” “I know!” shouted Barbara, with sudden excitement. “Let’s turn him into a girl!” The other girls snickered at this. Gerald was happy that he was getting all this lovely attention. “No, you can’t do that Barbara!” Annabel retorted, as if she was telling her off. “Yes we can!” shouted Daisy. “All we need to do is make him wear a dress!” “He looks beautiful!” said Daisy. “He’s still not one of us” she muttered, obstinately… “Time to wake up.” Geraldine rang in a monotone. Samantha moved towards the source of the voice, and uttered weakly, “Who – who are you? What have you done to me?” “My – my dress?” “Yes dear, I need your dress. Kindly take it off, please.” Samantha curled into a ball. “Please… don’t… don’t hurt me!” “I won’t harm you if you do exactly as I say. Take off your dress, now.” Samantha wondered if he was being serious. “And… if I do… you’ll – you promise you won’t hurt me?” “He – here..” she delicately extended her dress. Now, wearing nothing more than her undergarments, she was beginning to feel more exposed to the cold air, and goosebumps were appearing all over her delicate skin. “Come on, Annabel, help us!” Annabel couldn’t take it anymore. She stormed out of the room and walked to the garden, where she saw Mother watering the roses. Everything in the garden looked so much more beautiful and appealing than what she was seeing in there. It was peaceful and sunny. A perfect distraction from- “-Anna… Annabel!” She turned around, and saw Gerald - (of all people!) running towards her. She was surprised; he even sounded like a girl now. And now he followed her here. He was clearly mocking her. “He’s not my sister, Mummy. He’s just being really silly. Everyone’s being silly. They think he’s a girl.” Mother still could barely control herself. “Geraldine!” She moved forward and picked him up in her arms. “From now on, your name shall be Geraldine.” “But Mummy!” she wailed. “It’s not fair! Boys aren’t supposed to play dress up like that!” Mother turned affectionately to her eldest. “Annabel, my dear… why can’t you just pretend like everybody else? He doesn’t mind!” To this, Gerald smiled in approval. Annabel couldn’t. There was no way. As long as Gerald was a… All her friends gasped at this suggestion. “But that’s even more wrong!” objected Daisy. “Mummy will be very cross!” “No!” Annabel insisted, “It’s perfect! It will really work!” “No he isn’t really. It’s just pretend,” responded Annabel. “But when we do this, we won’t have to pretend anymore.” Soon Annabel’s friends were all taken by this suggestion. A mischievous smile formed on each their faces. They were all planning to do something really naughty. “When shall we do it?” asked Wendy? “Let’s do it tomorrow morning!” said Daisy. And once they happily reached a decision, then all resolved to walk outside and accompany Gerald. They took him to the swings and slides. Now Annabel was happy. Lifting young Gerald onto the slide, Annabel began to push. “Soon Gerald, you really will be my little sister!” Annabel’s friends giggled mercilessly at this. Gerald laughed, still not knowing what was going on… “Umm… excuse me… excuse me… sir?” “What did you just say, dear?” “I…” she began, nervously “I’m just… so cold. I’d really like my dress back.” The man looked like he was beginning to calm down. “Yes… yes… your dress. You’d like your dress back. I’ll umm… I’ll get you-” He turned back and began to fumble around in a small wooden box. “Get you… get you your-” Then once he’d found what he was looking for, he turned around, and retrieved what appeared to be a whip. “WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME!?” Samantha shrieked, and curled into a ball. “Huh!?” Geraldine quizzed. “You think this is disgusting!? Well, aren’t you a delightful little thing!? I was looking forward to both of us revelling in our shared womanhood together!” Samantha could not hold it in any longer. She puked all over the cage floor. Geraldine rolled his eyes and began to lose his temper. “You are just like everybody else…” he spluttered “You…-You don’t know what it’s like… you live an ordinary life… you’ve never even thought to question what you were! In another life… in another universe… I could have been just as beautiful and insipid as you.” Then, pulling up his knickers, he thwacked the cage door in frustration. There was a loud clink noise. Samantha did her best to distance herself from the pile of sick. “Now…” he began. “First, you’re going to clean up that pile of sick, and then we’re going to try this again from the start.” He rummaged through his box and found an old tea towel and some Febreeze. “As soon as… as… as soon…” The old man started to feel faint. His face slurred, and half of his face appeared to lag as if it was no longer functioning. He looked as if he was having a stroke. “As… soon as we…” Then, he tumbled down and collapsed in front of the cage door, and after nearly a whole minute writing in helplessness, he passed out cold on the floor. Samantha noticed he was carrying what looked like a set of keys in his right hand. It was too far away for her arms to reach, so, carefully navigating around the pile of vomit, she reached out with her bare leg and clasped onto it. Success! “Shhh…” whispered Annabel. “Here he comes.” Gerald was waltzing proudly through the lounge. Then, he saw Annabel and smiled at her. “Gerald! Come here! Good boy!” Gerald ran as fast as he could. Annabel led her out to the garden and turned towards him. “Gerald… you can’t play with us as long as you’re a boy.” Gerald cheekily smiled with an oblivious look of excitement. “So…” Annabel smirked, “we’re going to turn you into a girl!” “From now on, your name shall be “Geraldine” Atkins!” At this moment, Mother came into the garden and witnessed everything. She was mortified, and absolutely speechless. She began to felt unwell, and noticeably unhinged by the nightmarish scene in front of her. She immediately ran towards Geraldine and inspected the damage up close… then turned with horror to see the innocent look on Annabel’s face, as she wiped away the blood on her face. 3-year-old Geraldine was taken to the local hospital, which did their best to repair the damage, though he fell into a coma, and did not awaken until 3 years later. Once the details of this incident became public, Penelope Atkins was deemed unfit to be a mother and lost custody of her children. She later committed suicide. Once he finally woke up, Geraldine was left in the care of his grandparents, who would scorn and reject him, seeing him as a nothing more than a “mistake”, who would never amount to anything. “Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain… On the parchment of history ‘tis written O, how our enemies shall soon be smitten Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain!” “Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain… On the parchment of history ‘tis written O, how our enemies shall soon be smitten Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain!”"}

The thing was, 26-year-old Lena was somewhat poor. And by that, I mean she was flat-out broke. The hellhole rat's-ass of an apartment she lived in would just not do for her. She needed somewhere where people wouldn't bang on her wall and yell at her to \"shut the hell up\". Lena needed a place where she could be free, where the atmosphere of each room amplified the beauty of each individual note of a song. Right now, the only place she could perform was an abandoned warehouse, where she was all alone. She knew that the only way she could get what she knew she deserved was if she played beautifully. That way, people would pay money just to hear a thirty-second demo of her playing. And the only way she could accomplish that was with hard work and practice. Seated on her fold-up chair, she quietly put the bow up to the strings of her instrument. She didn't do anything for a moment. She just sat there, eyes closed, hoping that she would get this right. She knew that she couldn't afford to botch it up again. Finally, after a moment of waiting, she began to carefully move the bow. The first few notes were absolute perfection. Lena was surprised. But she didn't open her eyes. She just kept playing. The beginning of the song was going by smoothly. Very smoothly. The way she played was almost hypnotic, in that it mesmerized the listener and prevented them from going anywhere or paying attention to anything else. It was beauty in instrumental form. Lena was still anxious, though. But the more she played, and the more beautiful her song became, the less she worried about what would happen next and the more she just allowed her conscience to guide her hand, which guided the bow across the strings of her violin, and created some of the most incredible music heard by any being in all of existence. For some reason, the motivating flow that was flowing within her now got her to stand up. She was now dancing elegantly to the rhythm of her own playing. It was strange. She'd never danced once in her life, especially not with a violin in her arms playing the most amazing tune ever heard by mankind. Yet the way she danced was dazzlingly graceful. It was almost as hypnotic as her violin-playing. And that's when she did the craziest thing in the world. She improvised the song. And she did it to perfection . Lena now knew that her future was secure. With violin-playing skills as amazing and complex as hers, there was no way that her fantasies wouldn't be recognized. She was so good, that she could practically hear the applause. Actually, she could hear the applause. She finally stopped playing and opened her eyes. Around her were dozens of people, literally hundreds, that were clapping in a wild frenzy, clearly in love with her total fiddling expertise. She was absolutely stunned. She put her hands up to her mouth, which was now in a huge ear-to-ear grin, her eyes welling up with tears. Was this really happening? Was she just dreaming? She pinched herself. She was still surrounded by fans. This was definitely reality. Still in shock, she took her bows. And that's when someone walked up to her. He was an old man, with abnormally beautiful skin and hair, and a wig that looked like it dated back to the 17th century. He took a quick bow of respect, then said, \"Your violin playing was completely remarkable!\" \"My clients are internationally renowned, and I want to have you among them.\" Lena's eyes suddenly went wide. She rubbed them for a moment, then asked \"Are- are you serious?!\" \"More serious than the works of Beethoven.\" Lena was now jumping up and down in excitement. She was now only able to scream, \"Yes! Yes! Yes!!!\" Mr. Hanswell extended his hand. \"Then come with me.\" And with that, they were gone. The crowds dispersed, though some still followed the limo, desperate to get another listen of Lena's music. Her violin was broken into two pieces, with the bow being snapped in half, too. Her chair was missing a leg, and the back was faulty as well. Warehouse #14 was an infamous suicide hotspot in that city."}

She shut her eyes, letting the rays kiss her eyelids as she breathed deeply and shifted her focus onto what she planned to do next. Without warning a loud sound suddenly boomed from behind Serena, making her jump out of her skin and whip around to maybe make a run for it. But as she looked back she saw Andrew desperately trying to turn down the volume of a small black speaker as the warbling sound of country music destroyed the once quiet ambience of the night. “You fucking idiot!” Serena hissed. She took a few furious steps toward him. “I thought it would be funny!” he hissed back, now fumbling to turn the thing off altogether and stuff it back into his bag. Serena was beside herself: “You were right.” Andrew breathed, “This was worth it.” He began taking photographs. “What are you doing? There won’t be enough light inside, and we agreed using flash wouldn’t be a good idea.” Andrew asked, face quizzical. “Oh right, I’ll come up with you.” Alas, behind her came the snapping of wood and a cry for help. “Quick, help me up!” he shouted. But to Serena, the sound seemed muted as if underwater. Her mind was racing. It was calculating there was no time to untangle his foot from the wire before they were caught. “Ser-Serena!” Her brain calculated the look of shock and disapproval he’d worn upon seeing her drugs. “Serena, help me up you BITCH!” Finally, she thought about the statement he’d give against her when questioned over trespassing. The noise of pursuit was becoming louder and louder. In her panic and fear, it was Serena’s brain’s turn to freeze. It couldn’t stop her body as her hand slid into her bag, past her drugs, camera, purse, and magazine, till her fingers curled around the handle of her gun. Shaking only slightly, she pulled out the firearm and pointed it. Andrew’s face twitched in surprise, twisted in confusion then contorted in fear. There came a bang and a flash. Andrew’s murderer turned and fled. Serena’s eyes fell upon the little plastic bags and the murder weapon. Even through her tears, she began to laugh."}

As a little girl, I was always fascinated by plays, musicals, and in general, the arts. Having a talent for acting early on, I didn't so much want to become famous as I wanted to entertain. Not only did I want to act, I wanted to know the workings of the whole shebang. Just as much as an actor remembering their lines, lighting was important, cues were important, and generally, forming the correct environment for pleasant viewing happened to be part of what I wanted to learn. The stage at my college was built long ago, and to be honest, I’m not quite sure when. It's located inside a place called \"Shilling Hall\" in the university I attended. I do recall mention of it being renovated in the 1953. It’s very old fashioned, though, and it is meant to host live performances. There are rows upon rows of seats and above it all is a huge balcony for other people to watch from. I've never seen the place packed, but I’m hoping the next time I act, it will be. There are all kinds of rumors that this place is haunted, but of course, I've never seen any evidence, and being the type of person I am, I won’t believe anything until I see it. Previously, I’d seen people going up onto the balcony and leaving a few pieces of candy on the rail for this “ghost”. I honestly think the cleanup crew would just pick it up and toss it, so it was a waste of time in my opinion. Now see, this “ghost” was described as a little brown haired girl, about seven is what most people guessed, with her hair cut into a bob. She wears a white dress with a pink tie around it. She is simply called “The Rail Girl” due to appearing near the balcony rail to those who have seen her. I didn't used to believe in her, but I certainly changed my mind after a few events. A friend and I were chatting over lunch one day, and he, being quite superstitious, believed in the paranormal. He was yammering on about why that girl might be there. Like she could havee been a victim of rape or murder and she was built into the walls, or she might’ have fallen from the balcony to her death. I rolled my eyes. I highly doubted there was a ghost at all, so I told him, quite simply. “Ryan, shut up and eat your sandwich,” and he proceeded to with a sheepish grin. He knew I didn’t believe him, but he always came to me with his harebrained ideas. Ryan and I were working together on the stage later. We were setting up for another play’s rehearsal. He left a few pieces of candy on the rail. I laughed to myself, viewing it as some sort of ritual sacrifice. As we were setting up, the fog machine started to run by itself. Ryan’s eyes bulged and he ran to turn it off. It wasn't even on. Furthermore, it wasn’t even plugged in. He decided that maybe three pieces weren’t enough and scurried over to leave her half the bag. Needless to say, I wasn't giggling anymore. “Can I help you?” She stared at me, swaying back and forth in her white dress. She gave me a simple answer. “No.” She vanished before my eyes. I was spooked. I didn't go there alone after that."}

Molly and I thank you for your services.” Click The first Jack knew only by reputation, but the oily sheen that emitted from his too wide smile identified him as Graydon Marx. Jack's jaw dropped when he saw the people behind Marx were Chase and Molly Benson. Jack was just close enough to hear the end of their conversation. “...en can we see her, Mr. Marx?” “Oh presently, presently my dear, Chase. In fact that's where we're going now. Come along.” “What's the meaning of this, Marx? You said you were taking us to see our daughter!” “And so I have, Chase, so I have. She'll be here shortly. The fire, you see. We've found it draws them.” The millionaire smiled and moved to a tree at the edge of the clearing. In a smooth motion he hoisted himself up into a hunting platform set on the lower branches. “Ah, here she is now.” “Oh, my God! Baby!” Molly Benson threw herself at her child sweeping her up in a hug. Jack saw a look of ecstasy pass across the girl's face and a terrible hunger enter her eyes, as she suddenly opened her mouth and sank her teeth into her mother's neck. Molly screamed and Chase lunged for his wife as a fountain of blood erupted, washing June's face in gore. The girl rode her mother to the ground, worrying at the wound like a wild animal.

It wasn’t. We were being controlled by fear. We’re like prey, clueless and defenseless as we waited for the predator to come for us. We could try to seek help, but there’s no guarantee that help would come for us. After all, a predator makes sure that we’re cornered before he strikes. There was no chance of survival. As I came back to reality, I found myself staring blankly in space. I was seated there at the corner of the room, a place where I would be able to save myself from the usual classroom drama and a perfect spot for me to daydream where no one could interrupt me. The sudden change in the atmosphere in that four-cornered room was something that couldn’t be ignored. Everyone seemed to have left their own fantasy world and started to pay attention to that boy who was brave enough to open up a topic that no one dared to talk about. Mr. Hughes raised his brows, obviously taken aback by the boy’s question. Then a gentle smile crept on his wistful face. “Act of cleansing.” “Yes, Ms. Night is correct.” Mr. Hughes nodded. “It was believed to be an act of cleansing. Someone who has a very strong sense of righteousness may be driven to do such thing.” “I disagree, Ms. Johnson,” Mr. Hughes said. “We’re talking about a sociopath.” The girl arched a brow. “What’s the difference?” “We’ll continue this next meeting. See you.” He picked up his leather case and then strode out of the room. Following other students’ example, I stood up from my seat, picked up my things and joined the crowd. It’s time to go home. “Hey, Suzy, you know what Mr. Hughes was talking about, right?” Julia Johnson asked as she approached me. Julia Johnson’s short figure stood out in the crowd. Today she was wearing a pink dress to go with her single braid of dark hair. She’s such a darling. She’s always curious, always asking questions; but no answer ever satisfied her. I didn’t know whether she was just doing it to annoy people or she’s just really plain…curious. “Yes.” I stopped and waited for her to reach me. Then I smiled. “Jack the Ripper’s legend. It’s quite an interesting story.” “Tell me about him, please.” Julia’s wide brown eyes stared at me with a child’s curiosity. “We live on the same street, right? I’ll walk with you.” “Sure,” I replied. It was a surprise, to be honest. I didn’t expect her to go as far as walking home with me just to obtain information about Jack. Maybe it’s just me or maybe Hamilton’s question actually moved her. The distance from the school to my house was not that far, so walking was not much of a problem to me. The real problem was making it home safely. The sun was starting to set in the west horizon, painting the sky tangerine and purple. It was a beautiful sight. Everything was perfect; but beyond that false image was the fact that more people were going to die tonight. “Jack the Ripper was a legendary serial killer in England,” I told Julia. “And he mutilated prostitutes, right?” Julia asked. I nodded. “Uh-huh. He’s a high-functioning sociopath.” “Which means?” Julia’s brows knitted together in confusion. Julia’s expression soured. “Just like the serial killer in this town. We don’t know him. He’s just out there, waiting.” By that time, the sky was completely covered with darkness. Streetlights provided illumination, but they weren’t enough. Those things could not protect us from the beast. Darkness still surrounded us. There was no assurance. “This forest sure is creepy, no?” Julia said as we passed by the woods. Something moved in the darkness. I saw a horrendous sight, rendering my body frozen in response. This couldn’t be. “What’s wrong?” Julia stopped, her eyes widening. She must have sensed my sudden uneasiness. A lump formed in my throat. “It’s…him.” “Where?” Julia gasped. It was him. It was the town’s personification of Jack. The serial killer. It appeared right before my eyes. Yet…I never got a good look at his face. I couldn’t see his face. As quickly as he appeared, the killer left without any trace, taking his knife with him. Why didn’t he kill me? Why? Why let me witness this kind of horror? Just then, I heard myself scream. “What do I do?” I muttered, tears silently crawling down on my cheeks. “Ms. Night?” I looked up only to see Mr. Hughes walking up to my direction. As recognition registered on his face, he picked up his pace and ran to us. “What happened?” he asked, alarm evident in his voice. “Was it his doing?” Mr. Hughes asked, catching his breath. Why was he here? He lived in a completely opposite direction. Why was he here? Why was it like he’d run for miles just to get here? Did he know that the killer was after us? “Let’s call the police,” he said, offering his hand. I pushed myself up and backed away. Or could it be him? “Stay away from me!” I screamed, my voice coming out scratchy. “It’s you!” “What are you talking about?” Mr. Hughes stepped forward. “I’m here to help.” “It’s you…” I whispered. Just as he was about to jump on me, a patrol car came. The police officers quickly got off the car and drew their guns out, pointing them at Mr. Hughes. “Freeze!” said one of the officers. “Put your hands in the air.” Mr. Hughes did what he was told. Another officer approached him and inspected Mr. Hughes’ coat until he found something in one of the pockets. The officer held it up in the air. It was a knife. So I was right. It was him indeed. “You are under arrest,” the officer declared as he cuffed Mr. Hughes’ hands behind his back. “You’re coming with us.” “But-but I didn’t do anything! I can explain!” Mr. Hughes yelled, struggling as the officer led him to the car. Mr. Hughes looked at me like I did something wrong. It was like he just realized something. His eyes were wide with horror, but he didn’t say anything. “As for you,” said the other officer, pointing at me. “We’ll take you to your house and talk to your parents.” I swallowed and nodded. That mousy Mr. Hughes was gone now. No more threats. I threw the bloody knife into the sink and stepped into the shower."}

However, she tells us to stay. “I recorded him,” she says. We get out of the car and make our way over there, knocking hard on the front door. However, nobody answers. We can see lights flicking on and off intermittently, but we’re not sure what that’s supposed to mean. Was she trying to tell us to leave? We get a call from dispatch a few moments later. They’re telling us that Carol has called 911 again, saying that there are now multiple people in her house. They ask if we need backup. We say yes. As I pace around in petrified confusion, Beck speaks up: “There’s rooms here that shouldn’t be.” “What the hell are you talking about?” I ask in response. “I’ve been counting,” he says. “There were 9 total the last time we came. There are 10 now. You didn’t notice it?” I force myself to think hard. Subconsciously, I knew that something was off, but couldn’t pinpoint exactly what. However, I eventually realize. “The basement. There was only one door down there last time.” Beck nods. “Two now.” We hear a knock on the door about 10 seconds later. It sounds agitated. We look out the living room windows, but aren’t met with the red and blue police lights. We’re hesitant to answer, of course. I decide to take a step forwards, but Beck pulls me back. “Did you find him?” she asks, without any semblance of emotion in her voice. “I think he might be in the basement. Why don’t you go check?” Beck and I are frozen in shock. She just keeps looking at us, gesturing towards the basement door every now and then. The footsteps down there sound like they’re running in circles now. We ignore her request, abruptly brushing past her and bolting out of the front door. The backup still isn’t here, so we decide to just get into our car. However… we see somebody down the street peering through our driver-side window. He’s large, dressed in what appears to be a black full-body suit. He looks away from the window and directly at us. It’s hard to tell from this far, but the suit doesn’t seem to have any eye-holes. Beck speaks up: “Sir, please step back from the vehicle.” His voice cracks in the middle of the sentence. He’s terrified. As soon as Beck stops talking, the figure starts running towards us. It’s fast. Too fast. In the time that it takes for us to pull up our guns, we’ve realized that it’s actually moved past us, into the house. We waste no more time, running into the car, locking the doors and waiting until backup arrives. I don’t know how he expects us to do that. We drive back to the station in complete silence. As we park, Beck finally lets out a sigh. “Jack is fucking crazy, dude.” I look at him in confusion. “What are you talking about? Who the hell is Jack?” He reciprocates an equally confused stare at me. “What the hell are you talking about? The dude who owns the house.” “We need you. A woman dialed 911. Says that somebody’s in her house.” I hang up the phone and slump into the bed. I just want this nightmare to end. Credited to Mr_Outlaw_"}

Recording action and events during Operation Cleanup. I have been informed that I cannot record any information or personal opinions of the events that occurred January 14th, 2017 at 2100 hours. I am permitted to record private notes to myself in my personal journal so long as they are kept off the log.

Beginning sweep of perimeter. 13:50 : Clearing...Potentially hostile civilian helicopter, looks to be media. Waiting for orders. 13:55 : Command wants us to engage civilian chopper...quickly reverses decision. Command plans to fire ground missiles at chopper under guise of hostile OpFor with Platoon 05. 14:00 : Chopper brought down. Command orders us to fire on Platoon 05. 40mm cannon fired, all targets eliminated. 14:40 : Recon reports Team One is investigating. Team one breaks comms. Demands to know why high-power rounds hit the ground. Command reports as misses on the Chopper. Makes imperative that Team One has disobeyed orders and breached perimeter. Orders AC-130U 06 to keep watch. 14:45 : Team One hits communications again. Reports that evidently, Chopper was Civilian Media and brought down with a handheld RPG. AH-1 017 fires weapons at AC-130U 06. AC-130U 06 sustains damages and deploys flares to divert rockets fired. Command orders AC-130U 06 and AH-64's 014, 056, and 005 to fire upon Team One. 14:46 : AC-130U Sustains further damages from ground-to-air fire. Integrity at 75% percent, returning fire. One engine down, still able to operate on remaining three. (Personal Note: This is shit...the shit...) (Personal Note: Can hear men on the comms screaming. About their legs...their bodies...crying for their mothers...crying out to God...screaming...others yelling at each other to move, and I can hear the shells hit in the background. I can't keep doing this.) 15:00 : All targets eliminated. Comms open up again, but silence. Team One's commander informs us that we are doing the wrong thing here. Command jams signal and breaks Comms. Orders AC-130U 06 to move back to perimeter breach where the infected crowds and OpFor are running. 15:05 : OpFor have engaged both infected and troops from Team Two at Fifth Perimeter. Three-way attack, the infected crowds are large. Firing 25mm's at Infected and OpFor to reduce risk of hitting Team Two until Command informs us to do otherwise. (Personal Note: Even if they did, Fuck them. I'm not doing this again. FUCK IT. FUCK IT.) 15:10 : OpFor have breached security perimeter and Infected are pouring out. (Personal Note: we're all thinking the same thing here. Are we going to have a repeat again?\" 15:14 : Wilcox fires 125mm rounds down at the ground. Crew offers no response. Pilots circle around to make second pass. Team Two survivors screaming that they are taking \"Friendly Fire\" from \"Our birds in the air.\" 15:15 : mass of threats eliminated, scattered forces still outlying. switching to 25mm. 15:23 : All targets eliminated, Second group of hostiles reaching fourth Perimeter. Focusing with AH-64's. Targets engaged. 15:25 : Targets eliminated effectively with 125mm. Remainder of targets eliminated with 25mm Equalizer. (Personal Note: It never gets old, and you never get used to it.) 15:30 : Command orders all ground forces to pull back from the gate, and engages new procedures. Orders AC-130U 06 to remain on standby and carry out original orders until new orders are issued. (Personal Note: just...Captain's starting to piss me off. He really can't keep his mouth shut about what's going on. He's trying to tell us we're doing the right thing, we're not. We're getting paid. That's why we're here. We're getting paid, and we're being threatened with death if we don't.) 15:45 : AC-130U 06 circles around Third Perimeter again. Still on standby. 15:50 : Small group of infected spotted leaving first perimeter. AFC Hanson is uneasy and fires before they leave first perimeter. AFC Hanson is reprimanded by Captain Halberd for this. Officers still debating whether to report him to Command. AM Maxon takes over for Hanson. 15:55 : Hanson uneasy and is beginning to become irate. Cpt. Halberd makes note. (Personal Note: I'm getting sick of this. There's just nobody who can do this. I'd put Halberd on the gun and see if he can, Then again, I'm an airman enlistee and therefore am not entitled to have such opinions. Fuck that.) 16:05 : Hanson attempts to convince other crew to turn against Captain Halberd and Command. Attempts to convince that this is wrong and that we need to stop. Captain Halberd determines Hanson is an immediate threat to crew and has him restrained. Command is notified. (Personal Note: This isn't protocol. This is bullshit. They want to keep us in the air, but they don't want to deal with this either. They) 16:20 : Captain Halberd discharges his sidearm into Airman First Class Jeffrey M. Hanson. Hanson's cerebrum is destroyed by a single shot and is pronounced KIA. Captain Halberd informs the crew that he, as commanding officer of the crew, has permission by command to do this, and he informs us that he is Intelligence assigned because of the actions of last night. Captain Halberd orders us to open the bay door. Obliged. 16:21 : Hanson is disposed of by being tossed out the bay. We are told not to speak of this event. (Personal Note: Moriarty grows uneasy. speaks to me at a whisper that we need to get rid of Halberd. I inform him we will be in world of shit if we do. He explains that if we keep it quiet, then we explain Halberd committed suicide after elimination of Hanson due to emotional guilt. We throw his body out at the the order of Moriarty, and thus First Lieutenant Moriarty takes command. I...agree. But I inform him the action will have to be logged, whatever he does. We will need to make up for time. He orders Rimmer to cut comms and he will tell me what to log.) 16:38 : Bay doors open and Captain Halberd's body is summarily disposed of. Making rounds again. Standby. 17:35 : Rimmer is restrained by crew members and eliminated by First Lieutenant Moriarty. Command is informed. We are told by Command that the operation will follow different procedures which will be listed when we return to base. AC-130U 06 is ordered to return to base immediately. 18:30 : AC-130U 06 lands safely at base."}

Complete overhaul because of what happened with Team One. We are renaming the mission \"Operation Sterilization\" rather than \"Cleanup\". According to them, Cleanup seemed more colloquial and casual, or at least, that's what they told us. Sterilization was more direct, more formal sounding. It was the original name for the operators going in, and as far as we know, Seal Team Three's troops were slaughtered, fireteams scattered and broken up, and they've sent in the Marines in a direct engagement operation. The mission still remains the same, we watch the perimeter and keep infected inside the quarantine zone. I have begun to question this mission in the first three days. I've seen a lot...and done a lot...Shit ain't right. 12:30 : Leaving the runway. One more time. 13:00 : Nothing as of yet. Comms are coming on now, we're getting warned that the place is going to be a blitz when we arrive. Hordes of infected are reaching the third perimeter and the Gunships on patrol currently are running dry, so are the AH's. 13:33 : Firing at gate with 40mm to eliminate large groups of infected moving through the gate. Gate has allowed the narrow the wide formation of infected, making it easier to target and wipe out with the 40mm. Ground runs red with blood and guts. Quite a sight. 13:35 : Infected still breaching. Team Two is able to hold their ground with help from AH-64s. Luckily no special infected encountered. Command breaks line. Informs AC-130U 06 to get \"our asses in gear\" and eliminate the formation. 13:47 : Eric Maxon reports the 40mm gun has jammed. Crew Chief 2nd Lt. Peters is assisting him. We're without 40mm. We're firing the 125mm. But we don't have the \"inbetween\" for smaller groups. We can't waste howitzer ammunition on smaller groups of infected. 14:30 : Moriarty warns the crew that we may have to re-arm. I now see what Forward Command was talking about. The other gunship, AC-130U 03 is running dry as well. 14:35 : Estimated 1200+ Infected KIA. Looks be last horde of infected arriving, Est. 300+ infected. We can do this. Team Two informs me they're barely holding. They have lost a fifteenth of their unit. This is not good. 14:40 : Ran out of 125mm Howitzer shells. On last two packs for 40mm BOFORS cannon. Est. 125+ infected left, reaching fifth perimeter now. 14:55 : On approach to Firebase Alpha Strip. Control tells us to get back out quickly. Something's wrong. Firebase Alpha is warning us that some kind of very powerful giant infected is reaching the area. First line of defenses lost and are retreating. 15:53 : 125mm howitzer and 40mm BOFORS fired directly at creature. Knockback power is incredible, damage is visibly dealt to creature. Creature is large, at least seven meters tall. Humanoid, muscular. A pale salmon red. Yellowed eyes. Pulsing muscles visible, as well as large pulsating carbuncles and papules emanating blood and white liquid, most likely pus. Visible wound from shells, 125mm took off creature's arm. Blood is a dark yellow color. Creature is getting back up. 15:55 : Another round was fired, creature successfully dispatched. Damage assessment underway, Command urges control to get us re-armed to patrol again. Control and Command at disagreement right now. 16:00 : being refueled and re-armed. 16:20 : In the air again. 16:30 : Distress signal from surviving SEAL TEAM THREE, Troop One, Platoon 1 sent out. Confirmed Five SEALs from Platoon 1 survived. Platoon Two dispatched to provide aid. New orders issued to SEAL Platoon 1 and 2. These orders are not heard over Communications. 17:00 : It's been quiet. Moriarty warns that this isn't a good sign. 17:30 : All clear. Communications cut on. SEAL Platoon 1 and 2 are encountering heavy resistance, including a creature matching the description of the one faced at Firebase Alpha. Moriarty requests permission from Command to engage and provide air support. Command does not answer. 17:33 : Command denies request to provide support. No other air support will be dispatched as well. Moriarty makes request again. Command refuses due to executive orders. 17:35 : Comms open up again. SEAL platoons are down to thirteen men altogether. Requests immediate assistance. Command denies. FUCK COMMAND. THE SEALS NEED OUR FUCKING HELP. 17:50 : hit by RPG. Losing altitude but stable now. Something just hit the tail of the craft. Second RPG hit. Creature is confirmed crippled but still alive. 17:53 : SEALs confirm all targets eliminated. Multiple sustained damages, but still in the air. Unidentified humanoid creature breaks into craft, HULL BREACH. FU-- I've been tasked with carrying the log, but recording further information within LTJG Hudson's Journal. No point in writing two logs. This is AC-130U 06 Scorpio's Crew's last official log during Operation Sterilization. AFC Rainer, Chris H."}

Recording action and events during Codename: Operation Cleanup. The objective of this mission is to quarantine the infected zone, and our job as gunship AC-130H 06 Codename: Scorpio is to eliminate any potential infected leaving the quarantine zone until an effective course of action can be taken by the government. AC-130U Scorpio from the eyes of the leaving gunship. 01/14/2017. 13:40 : We have reached target zone. Smoke reaches the sky, distracting to pilots. Making it clear to pilots that our mission is to secure the perimeter, not the quarantine zone. 13:50 : Beginning perimeter control for the 24-hour period until AC-130U 04 enters airspace. AH-64 \"Apache\" helicopters patrol the inner city, Recon P-8 \"Poseidons\" from the Navy are reporting what's going on down there. (Personal note: Our work is cut out for us. We hardly have to do anything except shoot where they tell us to.) 14:00 : First potential target spotted. Identified from a closer view as a young male. Carrying backpack. Unarmed. Running fast. (Personal note: Good shot. Then again, we're firing 50 rounds a second.) 14:14 : Target eliminated. (Personal note. Target was quite gruesomely executed, split in half by multiple rounds. It's amazing to see what 150 25mm rounds can do to a person.) 14:30 : Warning has gone out via vehicle convoy that people are not permitted to leave Quarantine zone and should return to their homes until the Government can provide aid. (Personal note: Who are we bullshitting? We're going to go in and wipe them out anyway. At least I get paid enough to live with this.) 14:46 : Infected targets ambush both the hostile OpFor and friendly force. Still requesting permission from Command to engage. (Personal Note: I can't watch this. Even if it's hostiles they're killing, people, I don't care. You never get used to it.) 14:47 : Permission finally accepted, but told to efficiently use M102 Howitzer to neutralize the entire area. We will be firing on our own men down there. 14:48 : All targets, friendly or hostile, eliminated. 15:00 : Still circling perimeter. Things have quieted down around the perimeter, but Comms are saying that the city is a war zone right now. 15:30 : No important action as of yet. Command encourages that we keep logging even if nothing important has happened. (Personal Note: I don't see why.) 16:26 : Target eliminated. Clear kill. 16:45 : Convoy of armed hostile targets leaving quarantine zone, but are circling first perimeter. Permission to engage denied. 17:00 : Over comms, AH-64 021 appears to be uneasy about situation, requests permission to engage. Permission denied. 17:30 : Hostile Convoy stops at the edge of the first perimeter. Inactive. (Personal note: They're hostile, they're armed. And yet fucking rules of engagement in the way. We're going to get hit. I know it.) 17:42 : Command responds finally, and still does not clear us as we have not been fired upon and they have not yet left the first perimeter. Requests video feed of \"alleged stinger missiles\". AH-64 011 is hit by stinger. Going down. Command allows us to engage. 17:44 : Two out of six hostile vehicles destroyed. AH-64 011 is taking fire from an armed pickup truck. 40mm cannons fire upon truck. AH-64 011 does not respond. 17:45 : Five out of six hostile vehicles destroyed, two targets on foot. AH-64 021 takes hit and goes down. AH-1 004 takes out two foot targets, AH-64 030 destroys final vehicle target. (Personal note. Person at other end at command should be considered for disciplinary action. Personal note: That person can go fuck themselves.) 19:00 : Been time since last log. Logger apologizes for distance between logs, dispute settled between crew. Nothing to be worried about. 19:30 : Nothing as of yet. 19:35 : Scattered infected leaving city limits. Appear to be migrating. Confirmed infected. Waiting for okay to engage. 19:40 : Targets leave first perimeter, command clears to engage. 25mm minigun used on Infected. works effectively. All targets eliminated. 20:30 : Nothing as of yet. Crew is somewhat distracting but not at a disrupting or diverting level. (Personal note: Fuck... no... not this.) 21:00 : Crew returns to duties, identifies targets leaving first perimeter. (Personal note. Shouldn't have come... fuck... no...) 21:02 : Command gets feed. Permission to engage when targets reach the first perimeter. Crew, especially 25mm gunner appears to be weary and disturbed. Reminded of duties and mission. 21:03 : Targets reach perimeter. Still going. Command gives okay to engage with 25mm cannon. Gunner refuses to. (Personal note. Can't blame him, but we've got a job. Command's going to bitch about this... he could lose his job... court-martialed, jailed... or worse.) 21:05 : Command reminds First Lieutenant William F. Davidson of his duties and the reprimands he may face. He tells us this is wrong and that we can't do this. Command privately tells me to ensure the targets are eliminated. 21:16 : Still no movement. Infant is immobile. Movement from infant. Gunner takes shot. 21:30 : Command reprimands crew and demands that we carry out orders and return to base for debriefing. Crew is urged never to speak of this event again. 21:50 : Making final rounds. 22:00 : Returning to base as AC-130U 04 arrives at the perimeter."}
