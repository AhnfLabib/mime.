Then, not forgetting his parasol and his walking stick, he entered his old cottage. He carefully balanced his stick and his parasol in the closet, then walked into the kitchen. He put on the kettle, and as he did, Grimalkin purred as she leapt up near the kitchen sink. He gently stroked her black fur, as the kettle grew noisier. Then he remembered to feed her. “There’s a good puss… good girl…” he murmured. Once the kettle was singing, he poured himself some Earl Grey, gently blew over it, and then took a sip. “Let’s let Susie in the bedroom!” “No Susie can’t be there, it’s not her bedtime!” Just at that moment, Mother walked in, with a wide-eyed toddler beside her. “Girls?” she called out. “Gerald wants to play with you. Are you going to let him?” Annabel sighed. Not this again. Why couldn’t Gerald play with his own friends? “But Mummy! Gerald’s a boy! Boys can’t play with us!” Mother cooed. “Please… look at him. He loves his big sister. He desperately wants to play with you. Don’t you dear, Gerald?” Gerald looked really happy, but didn’t know how to express himself. “I don’t want to hear any arguing. Is that clear? Just let Gerald play with your dolls, and be nice to him.” Gerald toddled over to his older sister, and pointed to the house, which was almost bigger than he was. In an effort to get attention, he announced in front of Annabel and her friends, in as much English as he could, “It’s big!” Annabel’s friends were beginning to feel sorry for him. “Come over here, Gerald, help Susan get dressed for her day at school.” “No! Wendy! Gerald can’t play with dolls! Don’t let him touch her!” “I know!” shouted Barbara, with sudden excitement. “Let’s turn him into a girl!” The other girls snickered at this. Gerald was happy that he was getting all this lovely attention. “No, you can’t do that Barbara!” Annabel retorted, as if she was telling her off. “Yes we can!” shouted Daisy. “All we need to do is make him wear a dress!” “He looks beautiful!” said Daisy. “He’s still not one of us” she muttered, obstinately… “Time to wake up.” Geraldine rang in a monotone. Samantha moved towards the source of the voice, and uttered weakly, “Who – who are you? What have you done to me?” “My – my dress?” “Yes dear, I need your dress. Kindly take it off, please.” Samantha curled into a ball. “Please… don’t… don’t hurt me!” “I won’t harm you if you do exactly as I say. Take off your dress, now.” Samantha wondered if he was being serious. “And… if I do… you’ll – you promise you won’t hurt me?” “He – here..” she delicately extended her dress. Now, wearing nothing more than her undergarments, she was beginning to feel more exposed to the cold air, and goosebumps were appearing all over her delicate skin. “Come on, Annabel, help us!” Annabel couldn’t take it anymore. She stormed out of the room and walked to the garden, where she saw Mother watering the roses. Everything in the garden looked so much more beautiful and appealing than what she was seeing in there. It was peaceful and sunny. A perfect distraction from- “-Anna… Annabel!” She turned around, and saw Gerald - (of all people!) running towards her. She was surprised; he even sounded like a girl now. And now he followed her here. He was clearly mocking her. “He’s not my sister, Mummy. He’s just being really silly. Everyone’s being silly. They think he’s a girl.” Mother still could barely control herself. “Geraldine!” She moved forward and picked him up in her arms. “From now on, your name shall be Geraldine.” “But Mummy!” she wailed. “It’s not fair! Boys aren’t supposed to play dress up like that!” Mother turned affectionately to her eldest. “Annabel, my dear… why can’t you just pretend like everybody else? He doesn’t mind!” To this, Gerald smiled in approval. Annabel couldn’t. There was no way. As long as Gerald was a… All her friends gasped at this suggestion. “But that’s even more wrong!” objected Daisy. “Mummy will be very cross!” “No!” Annabel insisted, “It’s perfect! It will really work!” “No he isn’t really. It’s just pretend,” responded Annabel. “But when we do this, we won’t have to pretend anymore.” Soon Annabel’s friends were all taken by this suggestion. A mischievous smile formed on each their faces. They were all planning to do something really naughty. “When shall we do it?” asked Wendy? “Let’s do it tomorrow morning!” said Daisy. And once they happily reached a decision, then all resolved to walk outside and accompany Gerald. They took him to the swings and slides. Now Annabel was happy. Lifting young Gerald onto the slide, Annabel began to push. “Soon Gerald, you really will be my little sister!” Annabel’s friends giggled mercilessly at this. Gerald laughed, still not knowing what was going on… “Umm… excuse me… excuse me… sir?” “What did you just say, dear?” “I…” she began, nervously “I’m just… so cold. I’d really like my dress back.” The man looked like he was beginning to calm down. “Yes… yes… your dress. You’d like your dress back. I’ll umm… I’ll get you-” He turned back and began to fumble around in a small wooden box. “Get you… get you your-” Then once he’d found what he was looking for, he turned around, and retrieved what appeared to be a whip. “WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME!?” Samantha shrieked, and curled into a ball. “Huh!?” Geraldine quizzed. “You think this is disgusting!? Well, aren’t you a delightful little thing!? I was looking forward to both of us revelling in our shared womanhood together!” Samantha could not hold it in any longer. She puked all over the cage floor. Geraldine rolled his eyes and began to lose his temper. “You are just like everybody else…” he spluttered “You…-You don’t know what it’s like… you live an ordinary life… you’ve never even thought to question what you were! In another life… in another universe… I could have been just as beautiful and insipid as you.” Then, pulling up his knickers, he thwacked the cage door in frustration. There was a loud clink noise. Samantha did her best to distance herself from the pile of sick. “Now…” he began. “First, you’re going to clean up that pile of sick, and then we’re going to try this again from the start.” He rummaged through his box and found an old tea towel and some Febreeze. “As soon as… as… as soon…” The old man started to feel faint. His face slurred, and half of his face appeared to lag as if it was no longer functioning. He looked as if he was having a stroke. “As… soon as we…” Then, he tumbled down and collapsed in front of the cage door, and after nearly a whole minute writing in helplessness, he passed out cold on the floor. Samantha noticed he was carrying what looked like a set of keys in his right hand. It was too far away for her arms to reach, so, carefully navigating around the pile of vomit, she reached out with her bare leg and clasped onto it. Success! “Shhh…” whispered Annabel. “Here he comes.” Gerald was waltzing proudly through the lounge. Then, he saw Annabel and smiled at her. “Gerald! Come here! Good boy!” Gerald ran as fast as he could. Annabel led her out to the garden and turned towards him. “Gerald… you can’t play with us as long as you’re a boy.” Gerald cheekily smiled with an oblivious look of excitement. “So…” Annabel smirked, “we’re going to turn you into a girl!” “From now on, your name shall be “Geraldine” Atkins!” At this moment, Mother came into the garden and witnessed everything. She was mortified, and absolutely speechless. She began to felt unwell, and noticeably unhinged by the nightmarish scene in front of her. She immediately ran towards Geraldine and inspected the damage up close… then turned with horror to see the innocent look on Annabel’s face, as she wiped away the blood on her face. 3-year-old Geraldine was taken to the local hospital, which did their best to repair the damage, though he fell into a coma, and did not awaken until 3 years later. Once the details of this incident became public, Penelope Atkins was deemed unfit to be a mother and lost custody of her children. She later committed suicide. Once he finally woke up, Geraldine was left in the care of his grandparents, who would scorn and reject him, seeing him as a nothing more than a “mistake”, who would never amount to anything. “Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain… On the parchment of history ‘tis written O, how our enemies shall soon be smitten Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain!” “Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain… On the parchment of history ‘tis written O, how our enemies shall soon be smitten Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain!”"}

Decent, upstanding citizens who expected to live to a ripe old age, only to have the rug cruelly pulled out from under them, often naïve enough that they could be lured into the playroom under the most rudimentary of pretenses. That was much more preferable than having to bring them in by force and risk them making a commotion that could draw attention. “Mary Darling, what a coincidence. I was just thinking about you,” he answered cheerfully. “Heh-heh. That’s, ah, that’s hardly a coincidence, James Darling. I expect you to always be thinking about me,” Mary replied, trying to be playful, though it sounded like she was short of breath and, if such a thing were possible for her, unsettled. “Is everything alright?” James asked, suddenly concerned. “You sound a bit… out of sorts.” “What do you mean ‘something’?” “I… I don’t know if I can handle him on my own. Please, James Darling, come home now. I need you.” This was concerning, as the playroom should have automatically transmitted his statement to wherever Mary was. Either it wasn’t working, or Mary wasn’t in a position to respond. None of this was making any sense. The Darling Twins were eldritch demi-gods, ageless with superhuman might. And within their playroom, they were full gods with complete control over physical reality. What could Mary have possibly let in that she couldn’t handle? “It’s just a game. Mary likes playing the housewife. She just wants me to kill a spider for her so that she feels protected and cared for,” James muttered to himself as he took the control box off the door and slammed it shut. James could have summoned or conjured any weapon that he could imagine, but he started with his old stand-by; a hickory baseball bat splattered in dried blood. Whereas his sister favoured knives, James just loved the satisfying splat that one could only get by bashing someone’s skull in with a baseball bat. The sound of bones crunching, blood spattering, and brains squelching was beautiful to him. He could take someone out in one swing, if he wanted to. He often didn’t though, hitting them just hard enough to cause concussions and brain hemorrhaging, so as to give him the opportunity to deliver a more drawn-out and agonizing death. “James!” she cried, running into his arms and hugging him tightly as she began to weep. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to let it in, and now I can’t get rid of it. It keeps teleporting, and it won’t stay still long enough for me to kill it!” “Mary Darling, Mary, calm down. It’s okay. I’m here. Just tell me what we’re dealing with,” James said. Mary opened her mouth to speak, but froze at the sound of clawed footsteps clicking against the stone outside. Both of them spun towards the door, and saw the strange creature as it stepped into view. It was a hunchbacked and cloaked humanoid, leaning upon an angular shepherd’s crook. It was bluish-grey and squid-like, a single cyclopean orifice in its face with a pair of clawed and perforated tentacles hanging down almost to its midpoint. It was nearly seven feet tall as well, and looked like it could take more than a few swings with a baseball bat before going down. “Sir, if you are indeed a sir, you are trespassing in our home,” he said firmly. “My sister was only defending herself and our property from an intruder. If you do not mean us any harm, then I strongly urge you to explain yourself at once.” The creature's clawed toes dug into the stone floor as he clenched his feet, sending cracks racing out in all directions. A ring of mist began to swirl around his cyclopean orifice, the light within simmering in preparation for some kind of psychic assault, and semi-corporeal tentacles slowly began to unfurl from his back. Mary mouthed the word ‘Noodle’ to her brother, who nodded in agreement. He gently set down his bat, and she stuck her meat cleaver into the sash of her housecoat, as even when she was trying to be civil she couldn’t bear to be without a knife altogether. “I’m afraid my name doesn’t anglicize or latinize very well,” he replied, relaxing his defensive posture. “But Quixoto is the closest I can manage.” “Quixoto it is, sir! Delighted to make your acquaintance. Do I shake your hand or your tentacle?” James smiled. “My hand, if you please James. You haven’t earned a tentacle shake yet,” Quixoto replied, extending his right hand. “However you please, Mr. Quixoto,” James said as he shook his hand. “Mary Darling, why don’t you go put on some music and mix some drinks while I show our guest around?” “Thank you, Mary Darling, that’s so much better,” James shouted. Frank Sinatra began playing over an unseen intercom system, and James placed his arm around Quixoto’s shoulder. “Come, the walk back to the lobby will be so much more pleasant now. Can I offer you a cigar, or perhaps a cigarette? You breathe through those holes on your tentacles, I presume?” “I see,” James said softly, his eyes glancing up towards the hidden cameras. “And if we have no interested in selling?” “And what do interdimensional squid wizards use for money, if I may ask?” James smirked back. James paused midstride, taken aback by the sight of the strange gems. He began to reach out for one before stopping himself, only for Quixoto to push the bag towards him insistently. James tentatively picked up a drop and held it up to the light, rolling it in between his fingers as he allowed its psionic emanations to wash over him. “You really killed a god for these; or at least bled one,” he said in awe. “That’s why we use them for currency; so that people know what we’re capable of,” Quixoto boasted. “Take the whole bag. I’ll give you and your sister some time to work out what these are worth to you, and then we can negotiate on how many you’d need to sell this place.” James stopped them right in front of the large glass wall of an enormous aquarium. “Bet you can’t guess what we have in here,” James asked jokingly. He checked the exit sign nearest them, and while its arrow was pointing towards the aquarium, its light was red. “A sea monster?” Quixoto asked flatly. “That’s right, can’t get one past you,” James laughed, double-checking that they were within view of the cameras. “We named her Pool Noodle. She was Mary’s idea. I was worried that a three-tonne sea monster would basically be a white elephant in terms of upkeep, but it turns out that abyssal sea creatures have remarkably low metabolisms. Just a single human body is enough to sustain this girl for months. Although, I suppose any body would do.” “Can you hear me in there, Squid Wizard?” James shouted, mockingly banging on the glass with him. “I told you that Mary works wonders with the programmable matter; she can even make it teleportation-proof. She’s never bothered to do that to the whole place before, but now that we have to worry about ‘solicitors’, I imagine she’ll be changing that policy.” Quixoto frantically tapped and turned his glowing dials, slamming into the glass again and again with every teleportation attempt. A flurry of agitated air bubbles and garbled vocalizations erupted from his tentacles as he furiously clawed and pounded at the glass. This came to an abrupt stop, however, as the sound of a deep and eerily whale-like call came rumbling forth from the depths of the aquarium. James smiled widely, and Mary came out from across the hallway with an equally manic grin plastered onto her face. “I didn’t miss it?” she asked, handing her brother an old-fashioned cocktail. “You’re just in time, Mary Darling,” James said, accepting the drink with an appreciative nod. A spinning ring of glowing sigils and spell circles manifested around Quixoto’s waist as he attempted to either escape or at least curse the Darlings with his dying breath. Before he could finish the ritual, however, a creature that vaguely resembled a colossal viperfish or dragonfish came roaring up from below. Its massive maw clamped down on his body, impaling it with innumerable foot-long fangs and shaking it back and forth like a Great White Shark, staining the water a fluorescent blue with his blood. “So…” Mary said once the feeding frenzy was over, pausing to take a sip from her sweet martini. “… he was a realtor?”"}

As I closed it, I looked out over the sleeping neighborhood; it was so peaceful to look out upon. Knowing everyone slept, oblivious to the beauty surrounding them as they dreamt, was mind-boggling to me. Even though I was awoken prematurely from my own dreams, I was proud to have at least gotten the chance to see the beauty of the night so many missed out on. \"Alexandria,\" it spoke, its voice a deepened rasp. \"W-what?\" I stuttered, as a black mist surrounded us. \"After the debt was settled, the boy unlocked the car door and let the girl go.

Being that she was miles away from home, she began walking, clutching onto her sides as she proceeded down the street.\" \"Finally, she saw lights approaching from afar. Instinctively, the girl ran towards it, waving her arms in the air frantically as the lights grew close,\" it said, clearing its throat as it turned the page. Slowly, the being stood up, lowering its hood as it revealed eyes without irises. Just as swift as the words escaped its mouth, it flew out of the open window, a black mist trailing closely behind it. \"Mom!\" I yelled, afraid to get out of bed. \"Mom!\" I repeated, slowly lowering my feet to the cold floor. But, it wasn't the wood beneath my feet that I felt. The ground was rough, almost... like asphalt. Quickly, I realized I was outside standing in the middle of the street. \"Hello!\" I shouted, my voice cracking as anxiety washed over me. In the distance, a faint light approached. I wandered towards it, waving my arms in the air to attract the passerby's attention. \"Hey, I- I need help!\" I yelled, walking towards the light. \"Are you o-\" I trailed off. Once I saw the girl's face, all of the night's events became clear. She wasn't some random girl I tripped over coincidentally; she was me. My body was limp, all signs of life long gone. \"No,\" I said, lowering myself to the ground before standing up, weakly. \"You fucker!\" I screamed, running towards the car.

The thing was, 26-year-old Lena was somewhat poor. And by that, I mean she was flat-out broke. The hellhole rat's-ass of an apartment she lived in would just not do for her. She needed somewhere where people wouldn't bang on her wall and yell at her to \"shut the hell up\". Lena needed a place where she could be free, where the atmosphere of each room amplified the beauty of each individual note of a song. Right now, the only place she could perform was an abandoned warehouse, where she was all alone. She knew that the only way she could get what she knew she deserved was if she played beautifully. That way, people would pay money just to hear a thirty-second demo of her playing. And the only way she could accomplish that was with hard work and practice. Seated on her fold-up chair, she quietly put the bow up to the strings of her instrument. She didn't do anything for a moment. She just sat there, eyes closed, hoping that she would get this right. She knew that she couldn't afford to botch it up again. Finally, after a moment of waiting, she began to carefully move the bow. The first few notes were absolute perfection. Lena was surprised. But she didn't open her eyes. She just kept playing. The beginning of the song was going by smoothly. Very smoothly. The way she played was almost hypnotic, in that it mesmerized the listener and prevented them from going anywhere or paying attention to anything else. It was beauty in instrumental form. Lena was still anxious, though. But the more she played, and the more beautiful her song became, the less she worried about what would happen next and the more she just allowed her conscience to guide her hand, which guided the bow across the strings of her violin, and created some of the most incredible music heard by any being in all of existence. For some reason, the motivating flow that was flowing within her now got her to stand up. She was now dancing elegantly to the rhythm of her own playing. It was strange. She'd never danced once in her life, especially not with a violin in her arms playing the most amazing tune ever heard by mankind. Yet the way she danced was dazzlingly graceful. It was almost as hypnotic as her violin-playing. And that's when she did the craziest thing in the world. She improvised the song. And she did it to perfection . Lena now knew that her future was secure. With violin-playing skills as amazing and complex as hers, there was no way that her fantasies wouldn't be recognized. She was so good, that she could practically hear the applause. Actually, she could hear the applause. She finally stopped playing and opened her eyes. Around her were dozens of people, literally hundreds, that were clapping in a wild frenzy, clearly in love with her total fiddling expertise. She was absolutely stunned. She put her hands up to her mouth, which was now in a huge ear-to-ear grin, her eyes welling up with tears. Was this really happening? Was she just dreaming? She pinched herself. She was still surrounded by fans. This was definitely reality. Still in shock, she took her bows. And that's when someone walked up to her. He was an old man, with abnormally beautiful skin and hair, and a wig that looked like it dated back to the 17th century. He took a quick bow of respect, then said, \"Your violin playing was completely remarkable!\" \"My clients are internationally renowned, and I want to have you among them.\" Lena's eyes suddenly went wide. She rubbed them for a moment, then asked \"Are- are you serious?!\" \"More serious than the works of Beethoven.\" Lena was now jumping up and down in excitement. She was now only able to scream, \"Yes! Yes! Yes!!!\" Mr. Hanswell extended his hand. \"Then come with me.\" And with that, they were gone. The crowds dispersed, though some still followed the limo, desperate to get another listen of Lena's music. Her violin was broken into two pieces, with the bow being snapped in half, too. Her chair was missing a leg, and the back was faulty as well. Warehouse #14 was an infamous suicide hotspot in that city."}

She shut her eyes, letting the rays kiss her eyelids as she breathed deeply and shifted her focus onto what she planned to do next. Without warning a loud sound suddenly boomed from behind Serena, making her jump out of her skin and whip around to maybe make a run for it. But as she looked back she saw Andrew desperately trying to turn down the volume of a small black speaker as the warbling sound of country music destroyed the once quiet ambience of the night. “You fucking idiot!” Serena hissed. She took a few furious steps toward him. “I thought it would be funny!” he hissed back, now fumbling to turn the thing off altogether and stuff it back into his bag. Serena was beside herself: “You were right.” Andrew breathed, “This was worth it.” He began taking photographs. “What are you doing? There won’t be enough light inside, and we agreed using flash wouldn’t be a good idea.” Andrew asked, face quizzical. “Oh right, I’ll come up with you.” Alas, behind her came the snapping of wood and a cry for help. “Quick, help me up!” he shouted. But to Serena, the sound seemed muted as if underwater. Her mind was racing. It was calculating there was no time to untangle his foot from the wire before they were caught. “Ser-Serena!” Her brain calculated the look of shock and disapproval he’d worn upon seeing her drugs. “Serena, help me up you BITCH!” Finally, she thought about the statement he’d give against her when questioned over trespassing. The noise of pursuit was becoming louder and louder. In her panic and fear, it was Serena’s brain’s turn to freeze. It couldn’t stop her body as her hand slid into her bag, past her drugs, camera, purse, and magazine, till her fingers curled around the handle of her gun. Shaking only slightly, she pulled out the firearm and pointed it. Andrew’s face twitched in surprise, twisted in confusion then contorted in fear. There came a bang and a flash. Andrew’s murderer turned and fled. Serena’s eyes fell upon the little plastic bags and the murder weapon. Even through her tears, she began to laugh."}

As a little girl, I was always fascinated by plays, musicals, and in general, the arts. Having a talent for acting early on, I didn't so much want to become famous as I wanted to entertain. Not only did I want to act, I wanted to know the workings of the whole shebang. Just as much as an actor remembering their lines, lighting was important, cues were important, and generally, forming the correct environment for pleasant viewing happened to be part of what I wanted to learn. The stage at my college was built long ago, and to be honest, I’m not quite sure when. It's located inside a place called \"Shilling Hall\" in the university I attended. I do recall mention of it being renovated in the 1953. It’s very old fashioned, though, and it is meant to host live performances. There are rows upon rows of seats and above it all is a huge balcony for other people to watch from. I've never seen the place packed, but I’m hoping the next time I act, it will be. There are all kinds of rumors that this place is haunted, but of course, I've never seen any evidence, and being the type of person I am, I won’t believe anything until I see it. Previously, I’d seen people going up onto the balcony and leaving a few pieces of candy on the rail for this “ghost”. I honestly think the cleanup crew would just pick it up and toss it, so it was a waste of time in my opinion. Now see, this “ghost” was described as a little brown haired girl, about seven is what most people guessed, with her hair cut into a bob. She wears a white dress with a pink tie around it. She is simply called “The Rail Girl” due to appearing near the balcony rail to those who have seen her. I didn't used to believe in her, but I certainly changed my mind after a few events. A friend and I were chatting over lunch one day, and he, being quite superstitious, believed in the paranormal. He was yammering on about why that girl might be there. Like she could havee been a victim of rape or murder and she was built into the walls, or she might’ have fallen from the balcony to her death. I rolled my eyes. I highly doubted there was a ghost at all, so I told him, quite simply. “Ryan, shut up and eat your sandwich,” and he proceeded to with a sheepish grin. He knew I didn’t believe him, but he always came to me with his harebrained ideas. Ryan and I were working together on the stage later. We were setting up for another play’s rehearsal. He left a few pieces of candy on the rail. I laughed to myself, viewing it as some sort of ritual sacrifice. As we were setting up, the fog machine started to run by itself. Ryan’s eyes bulged and he ran to turn it off. It wasn't even on. Furthermore, it wasn’t even plugged in. He decided that maybe three pieces weren’t enough and scurried over to leave her half the bag. Needless to say, I wasn't giggling anymore. “Can I help you?” She stared at me, swaying back and forth in her white dress. She gave me a simple answer. “No.” She vanished before my eyes. I was spooked. I didn't go there alone after that."}

Molly and I thank you for your services.” Click The first Jack knew only by reputation, but the oily sheen that emitted from his too wide smile identified him as Graydon Marx. Jack's jaw dropped when he saw the people behind Marx were Chase and Molly Benson. Jack was just close enough to hear the end of their conversation. “...en can we see her, Mr. Marx?” “Oh presently, presently my dear, Chase. In fact that's where we're going now. Come along.” “What's the meaning of this, Marx? You said you were taking us to see our daughter!” “And so I have, Chase, so I have. She'll be here shortly. The fire, you see. We've found it draws them.” The millionaire smiled and moved to a tree at the edge of the clearing. In a smooth motion he hoisted himself up into a hunting platform set on the lower branches. “Ah, here she is now.” “Oh, my God! Baby!” Molly Benson threw herself at her child sweeping her up in a hug. Jack saw a look of ecstasy pass across the girl's face and a terrible hunger enter her eyes, as she suddenly opened her mouth and sank her teeth into her mother's neck. Molly screamed and Chase lunged for his wife as a fountain of blood erupted, washing June's face in gore. The girl rode her mother to the ground, worrying at the wound like a wild animal.

It wasn’t. We were being controlled by fear. We’re like prey, clueless and defenseless as we waited for the predator to come for us. We could try to seek help, but there’s no guarantee that help would come for us. After all, a predator makes sure that we’re cornered before he strikes. There was no chance of survival. As I came back to reality, I found myself staring blankly in space. I was seated there at the corner of the room, a place where I would be able to save myself from the usual classroom drama and a perfect spot for me to daydream where no one could interrupt me. The sudden change in the atmosphere in that four-cornered room was something that couldn’t be ignored. Everyone seemed to have left their own fantasy world and started to pay attention to that boy who was brave enough to open up a topic that no one dared to talk about. Mr. Hughes raised his brows, obviously taken aback by the boy’s question. Then a gentle smile crept on his wistful face. “Act of cleansing.” “Yes, Ms. Night is correct.” Mr. Hughes nodded. “It was believed to be an act of cleansing. Someone who has a very strong sense of righteousness may be driven to do such thing.” “I disagree, Ms. Johnson,” Mr. Hughes said. “We’re talking about a sociopath.” The girl arched a brow. “What’s the difference?” “We’ll continue this next meeting. See you.” He picked up his leather case and then strode out of the room. Following other students’ example, I stood up from my seat, picked up my things and joined the crowd. It’s time to go home. “Hey, Suzy, you know what Mr. Hughes was talking about, right?” Julia Johnson asked as she approached me. Julia Johnson’s short figure stood out in the crowd. Today she was wearing a pink dress to go with her single braid of dark hair. She’s such a darling. She’s always curious, always asking questions; but no answer ever satisfied her. I didn’t know whether she was just doing it to annoy people or she’s just really plain…curious. “Yes.” I stopped and waited for her to reach me. Then I smiled. “Jack the Ripper’s legend. It’s quite an interesting story.” “Tell me about him, please.” Julia’s wide brown eyes stared at me with a child’s curiosity. “We live on the same street, right? I’ll walk with you.” “Sure,” I replied. It was a surprise, to be honest. I didn’t expect her to go as far as walking home with me just to obtain information about Jack. Maybe it’s just me or maybe Hamilton’s question actually moved her. The distance from the school to my house was not that far, so walking was not much of a problem to me. The real problem was making it home safely. The sun was starting to set in the west horizon, painting the sky tangerine and purple. It was a beautiful sight. Everything was perfect; but beyond that false image was the fact that more people were going to die tonight. “Jack the Ripper was a legendary serial killer in England,” I told Julia. “And he mutilated prostitutes, right?” Julia asked. I nodded. “Uh-huh. He’s a high-functioning sociopath.” “Which means?” Julia’s brows knitted together in confusion. Julia’s expression soured. “Just like the serial killer in this town. We don’t know him. He’s just out there, waiting.” By that time, the sky was completely covered with darkness. Streetlights provided illumination, but they weren’t enough. Those things could not protect us from the beast. Darkness still surrounded us. There was no assurance. “This forest sure is creepy, no?” Julia said as we passed by the woods. Something moved in the darkness. I saw a horrendous sight, rendering my body frozen in response. This couldn’t be. “What’s wrong?” Julia stopped, her eyes widening. She must have sensed my sudden uneasiness. A lump formed in my throat. “It’s…him.” “Where?” Julia gasped. It was him. It was the town’s personification of Jack. The serial killer. It appeared right before my eyes. Yet…I never got a good look at his face. I couldn’t see his face. As quickly as he appeared, the killer left without any trace, taking his knife with him. Why didn’t he kill me? Why? Why let me witness this kind of horror? Just then, I heard myself scream. “What do I do?” I muttered, tears silently crawling down on my cheeks. “Ms. Night?” I looked up only to see Mr. Hughes walking up to my direction. As recognition registered on his face, he picked up his pace and ran to us. “What happened?” he asked, alarm evident in his voice. “Was it his doing?” Mr. Hughes asked, catching his breath. Why was he here? He lived in a completely opposite direction. Why was he here? Why was it like he’d run for miles just to get here? Did he know that the killer was after us? “Let’s call the police,” he said, offering his hand. I pushed myself up and backed away. Or could it be him? “Stay away from me!” I screamed, my voice coming out scratchy. “It’s you!” “What are you talking about?” Mr. Hughes stepped forward. “I’m here to help.” “It’s you…” I whispered. Just as he was about to jump on me, a patrol car came. The police officers quickly got off the car and drew their guns out, pointing them at Mr. Hughes. “Freeze!” said one of the officers. “Put your hands in the air.” Mr. Hughes did what he was told. Another officer approached him and inspected Mr. Hughes’ coat until he found something in one of the pockets. The officer held it up in the air. It was a knife. So I was right. It was him indeed. “You are under arrest,” the officer declared as he cuffed Mr. Hughes’ hands behind his back. “You’re coming with us.” “But-but I didn’t do anything! I can explain!” Mr. Hughes yelled, struggling as the officer led him to the car. Mr. Hughes looked at me like I did something wrong. It was like he just realized something. His eyes were wide with horror, but he didn’t say anything. “As for you,” said the other officer, pointing at me. “We’ll take you to your house and talk to your parents.” I swallowed and nodded. That mousy Mr. Hughes was gone now. No more threats. I threw the bloody knife into the sink and stepped into the shower."}

However, she tells us to stay. “I recorded him,” she says. We get out of the car and make our way over there, knocking hard on the front door. However, nobody answers. We can see lights flicking on and off intermittently, but we’re not sure what that’s supposed to mean. Was she trying to tell us to leave? We get a call from dispatch a few moments later. They’re telling us that Carol has called 911 again, saying that there are now multiple people in her house. They ask if we need backup. We say yes. As I pace around in petrified confusion, Beck speaks up: “There’s rooms here that shouldn’t be.” “What the hell are you talking about?” I ask in response. “I’ve been counting,” he says. “There were 9 total the last time we came. There are 10 now. You didn’t notice it?” I force myself to think hard. Subconsciously, I knew that something was off, but couldn’t pinpoint exactly what. However, I eventually realize. “The basement. There was only one door down there last time.” Beck nods. “Two now.” We hear a knock on the door about 10 seconds later. It sounds agitated. We look out the living room windows, but aren’t met with the red and blue police lights. We’re hesitant to answer, of course. I decide to take a step forwards, but Beck pulls me back. “Did you find him?” she asks, without any semblance of emotion in her voice. “I think he might be in the basement. Why don’t you go check?” Beck and I are frozen in shock. She just keeps looking at us, gesturing towards the basement door every now and then. The footsteps down there sound like they’re running in circles now. We ignore her request, abruptly brushing past her and bolting out of the front door. The backup still isn’t here, so we decide to just get into our car. However… we see somebody down the street peering through our driver-side window. He’s large, dressed in what appears to be a black full-body suit. He looks away from the window and directly at us. It’s hard to tell from this far, but the suit doesn’t seem to have any eye-holes. Beck speaks up: “Sir, please step back from the vehicle.” His voice cracks in the middle of the sentence. He’s terrified. As soon as Beck stops talking, the figure starts running towards us. It’s fast. Too fast. In the time that it takes for us to pull up our guns, we’ve realized that it’s actually moved past us, into the house. We waste no more time, running into the car, locking the doors and waiting until backup arrives. I don’t know how he expects us to do that. We drive back to the station in complete silence. As we park, Beck finally lets out a sigh. “Jack is fucking crazy, dude.” I look at him in confusion. “What are you talking about? Who the hell is Jack?” He reciprocates an equally confused stare at me. “What the hell are you talking about? The dude who owns the house.” “We need you. A woman dialed 911. Says that somebody’s in her house.” I hang up the phone and slump into the bed. I just want this nightmare to end. Credited to Mr_Outlaw_"}

It was coming from behind me, above me, from my left and right, from everywhere at once. I woke up before Widya did the next morning, which was a miracle because she usually woke up first for her morning prayers. She was surprised to see me sitting up, and my facial expression must have told her that something wasn’t quite right. I told her what happened; after giving me a very nervous look she assumed her position on her mat facing the East, and started praying. I woke up the other girls on the floor, gathered them in the corridor, and told them the same story. I remember that the other girls from the Philippines were spooked, as was Boupha, the only girl from Cambodia. The Vietnamese were a little calmer about it. The eldest girl, Dao from Laos, was visiting her sister who lived near Chulalongkorn, which was unfortunate because she seemed like the type who would have her wits about her at a time like this. She once told us that her home was haunted by spirits who shook her bed at night. The boys in the program didn’t comment much, although one suggested placing a Buddha image in our room. Thavin from Laos taught me how to properly pay my respects to the Buddha image at the entrance of the dormitory with the full Buddhist bow, which I have since perfected. After dinner, Widya went to our room to attend to her evening prayers and thesis, while I stayed in the lobby with the others. About an hour later, she appeared in a blaze of panic. “ANNA! ANNA! ANNA!” She ran right into me and I hugged her, asking, “What happened? What’s going on?\" Things were starting to make sense. But I was still wondering why, of all the occupied rooms on that floor, she was frequenting ours. \"Did you ask permission to stay?” a Thai student asked. “What? What permission?” I said. “Permission from chao tee, we always ask permission before staying.” I felt ashamed for not knowing this, and I was so sorry for being disrespectful of the spirits. It turned out that for all the other rooms, at least one of them asked for permission to stay. It just so happened that they placed one Filipino and one Indonesian, who didn’t know about the practice, in the same room. The others knew about it because they grew up in Buddhist societies where this is common. The Thai students assured us that she meant no harm. If anything, she was trying to welcome us. Widya and I mustered all our courage, marched right back up to our room, and asked the chao tee to grant us permission to stay. We spoke in our native languages, hoping that the sentiments will somehow transcend the language barrier. Credited to childfreefilipina"}

I don’t know why, I suppose I just want a place to compile all my thoughts. Unfortunately, the trip has been uneventful so far. The wilderness has been more of the same, large titanic forests surrounded by lush undergrowth. The cool, sticky air clung to our jumpsuits while we traversed through the planets landscape. This planet feels so similar, yet alien. Untouched by society, I wonder if earth once looked like this? We stumbled across a pond towards the end of the day, it was a murky colour with algae and several fallen branches floating on it. On the opposite end of the pond stood a large creature drinking the water, similar in shape to a deer, though its fur was a deep black and its antlers held more resemblance to a goat’s horns than a deer’s antlers. It was mesmerizing. It raises a question though, if there are prey, how come we haven’t come across any predators? The others have fallen asleep, were going to continue exploring in the morning. I’m going to try and get some shuteye. Ill report our findings next time I get a chance. Strange findings. Early in the morning we came across an odd sight. We came across a rather large waterfall, a brilliant blue colour. The rushing water sparkled with life. A couple meters away from the waterfall stood a sight which stopped all of us in our tracks. There was a campsite. There was a campsite. The rest of the day passed without incident, for the most part. Halfway through the day, I started catching whiffs of a strange scent. It was sickeningly sweet, combined with the smell of rotten fish. It was incredibly pungent and only grew stronger as the day went on. Its dusk now as I write this, the air is unpleasantly warm. I keep thinking back to that campsite, what was it doing there, and what happened to its occupants? I must’ve fallen asleep last night because when I woke up Fritz was gone. We looked for hours but we couldn’t find him. We couldn’t even find footprints. I’ll report back by the end of the day. On the way back, we stopped at the campsite. The colonists that stayed behind were gone. But I hardly noticed due to the change in the landscape. The waterfall was murky, green and bubbling. A far cry from the beautiful cataract that it once was. The air felt oppressive and polluted, the feeling was only strengthened by the pungent stench that now completely enveloped my senses. Everyone was anxious to go, but I wanted to check the place out further. I was investigating one of the sleeping bags when I noticed it. It was a small fissure in the earth, roots and vines sprawled out of it. I put my face closer to it, inches away from the crack in the coarse ground. After a moment of scrutinizing the crevice I noticed something. Deep inside the fissure a face stared at me. Yeah, a goddamn face. The worst part is that I recognized her. Maya, I believe her name was. Roots intertwined with her rough, dirty face. She attempted to cry out, but the roots appeared to be strangling her, dragging her into the depths. We’ve set up camp a few miles out from the site. It’ll be a day’s walk to get back to the colony in the morning. The smell is absolutely overpowering me now, I don’t know how the others have gotten any sleep at all. We started this journey with 12 people, now we have 5. Ill report my findings next time I get a chance. I saw it happen this time. It was very late last night when it happened. I was leaning against a nearby tree when I saw a fissure erupt from the ground near Gerald. Roots slowly crept from the crevice, making their way towards him. The roots surrounded Gerald, tightening around him. His eyes flipped open, but it was too late for him. The roots violently brought him back into the hole, thrashing against his weight. I snapped myself out of the daze I was in and sprang into action. I tried to hold onto him, but the roots tore him away from my grasp. I cried out, waking the others up. There was panic, screaming and all the while we struggled against the roots in an attempt to save Gerald’s life. The roots overpowered us, dragging him into the fissure before promptly closing up. We’ve decided not to rest again until we reach the colony. I’ll update the journal once we reach home. Hopefully I have some good news for a change. I’ve found this planet to be exceedingly cruel. It was dusk when we reached the colony. Lisa wanted to stay here to try and get the ship working. Everyone else wanted to try our luck in the wilds, that place wasn’t safe. Unfortunately, we couldn’t convince her to come with us. Its sunrise now, we’ve been trudging through this planet nonstop for several hours. We’re taking a break for a few moments so I’m using the opportunity to write this entry. Well that could’ve gone better. The idea was that we would sleep in the branches of a tree for the night. Our logic was that it can’t get us if were up high enough. I was assigned with keeping watch for the first half of the night. Things were fine until a few hours into my shift, when I was having trouble maintaining consciousness. It was 1:37 AM when I finally succumbed to my need for sleep. I woke up to Sasha pushing me awake, her eyes were wide, and she looked like she was on the verge of tears. She pointed towards the end of the branch where Paul was sitting, that’s when I saw it. A branch was sticking out of his mouth. It must’ve been growing throughout all his body, he writhed in agony, trying to scream, trying to be heard. We decided to end his suffering. The sound of the shot rang out for miles. I watched as the branch in his body slowly withered away, his body returned to flesh and he dropped from the tree with a sickening crunch. We decided to burn him, I don’t trust this planet enough for a proper burial. Me and Sasha both decided to avoid trees from now on. I never liked Paul that much, but I still feel a strong sense of loss. He was one of the few people left on this godforsaken planet. I wonder what happened to the others? What does this place need us for? I discovered something odd today. I brought the flaming stick towards a tree, it seemingly shriveled up the closer the flame got. The moment my makeshift torch hit the tree it ignited like it was doused in gasoline. Until I heard the roar. I shouted at Sasha for the gun as I slowly backed away. I don’t know what happened, we packed up immediately. We traveled for a few hours before finding a place to rest again. Fear the earth lest it devour you whole, fear the trees for they hold secrets that you’ll never know. I’m all alone now. I don’t know if it was because of the loneliness, the fear, the knowledge that our rations are running low, or just the tiredness. But I guess she couldn’t take it anymore. I decided to burn her body. She wouldn’t have wanted it to be taken. We never talked much, even when it was just the two of us, but I felt close to her. I thought about joining her, but I don’t really see the point. Maybe I’ll be rescued eventually and get off this horrible planet. But until then, I’ve decided to keep going This planet is getting restless, I can feel it, and I don’t know how much longer it’s going to wait. I’m so tired. I haven’t slept in days and I’m out of supplies. The water is poison. The plants are inedible. The meat of any animals I manage to kill rot within seconds. I think I’ve figured out why this place doesn’t have any predators. It’s because this place IS a predator. It lures people like us in with its bountiful resources and lush landscape, and when our guard is down, it goes in for the kill. I hate this place. My only hope is that someone finds this journal and gets out before it’s too late. At this point, I just want to know what awaits me deep below the ground. Will it just eat me? Or is there something more? I found a nice spot to lie down for a while. I wonder if I’ll see the others when I’m down there?"}

He couldn't help but grimace at the thought that he was as far from Santa as humanly possible. “What do you want?” Patrick asked. Innately, he knew that the creature wanted something. The creature smiled, licking his lips. “Thine tender fruit, not spoiled by the worms of new but by the tree that bore it… ripened not into ambrosia but a rotten, hollow core…” “I… I can’t say I understand…” Patrick stammered out. The creature smiled again. Patrick couldn’t understand why the creature would want the game system, but he felt it necessary to give it up. He quickly bolted downstairs, grabbing the box and, clutching it tight, he sprinted back up to his son’s room. The creature, upon his arrival, thrust Patrick’s son to the floor and held out one long, beckoning hand.

I was prepared, a clothespin pinning my nostrils shut, a garbage bag in one hand, the strongest cleaner I could find in the other, and long rubber gloves to keep my skin from having to touch what was inside. But, as it turns out, I needed none of those things. I called the cops, and naturally, they took me in for interrogation. It’s kind of hard not to suspect the man with a corpse in his garage, after all. Thankfully, they soon realized I wasn’t involved. My DNA might have been all over that box, the smell might have left a mark throughout my house, but there was one piece of irrefutable evidence in my neighbor’s own hands that proved my innocence: a vlogging camera. My neighbor was sitting in the box outside of a shipping facility, laughing as he told the world how he was going to mail himself across state lines. He’d brought pee bottles, food, a pillow, and a few flashlights. His friend – a guy I’d seen at his place several times to help with his stunts –, closed the lid and presumably dropped him off for shipment. Throughout the next couple of hours…or days, I’m honestly not sure, my neighbor recorded a few short clips about his progress. ‘I think I’m in a truck now, I can feel it moving’, ‘Must be in a warehouse. Pretty warm here. Still got plenty of food!’, that kind of stuff. And then, on the last entry, the box toppled over. He broke his neck, and that was it. The camera recorded until either the memory card got too full, or the battery died. There’s one thing I didn’t tell the police after they showed me the video. One thing I heard in the footage that will haunt me to the day I die. Just after the tumble that broke his neck, I heard the familiar screeching sound of my garage door. Credited to manen_lyset"}

I need to swallow the lump in my throat and collect myself. I need to breathe deeply. I need to wipe the tears from my eyes and the sweat from my brow. Look, all this thinking isn't for nothing. It's not like I'm invulnerable. I've been cut and bruised and bombarded by the ones I love. I’m no stranger to feeling vulnerable and damaged. The only question which resides within my mind now is this. As I write this, I look down at my right arm. The scars and bruises I received from breaking that window cover the surface of my arm. They exist as physical reminders of the deep emotional cuts that still haven't healed. The gun still sits beside me on my desk, and I can't help my straying eyes wandering over to it. The thought of using it on myself is tempting, but I shouldn't. Not yet, anyway. You see, I don't wish to end my life because of the accident, or any specific actions I have done at all for that matter. There's something else. Something more compels me to try and take my life. So please, allow me to further explain my predicament. Many hours and stitches later, my doctor entered the room where I was resting. He approached me; a smile plastered on his face. \"Yeah, just my luck,\" I responded. I didn't care to say anything else, for the man's final words were all I could think of. I can feel the pain swelling within me, and not just in the form of emotional torment. I feel physically ill. My ribs are visible through my rough, leathery skin, and my arms have grown weary just from this minute amount of writing. I sleep twelve hours a day on average, and that doesn't include the various naps I take throughout the afternoon. I need to finish this quickly, so I think it’s time I write candidly to you about my latest plight, and the reason why I ultimately believe I need to go through with my \"suicide\". Three months. Well then, let's test my luck one last time."}

Oh what fun it is to sing a sleighing song tonight. Finally managing to make eye contact with the simian faced bartender who was absent-mindedly pushing a dishtowel up and down a pint glass, Caleb waved a fiver in the air, a wry smile of what the fuck? on his face. Red and green Christmas tree lights flickered over the bottles and mirrors and off in the corner the Ghost of Christmas Past grinned its horrid smile. The bartender nodded acknowledgment and strutted over. “Beer and a whiskey.” “What kinda beer? What kinda whiskey?” “The cheapest.” The bartender got him his drinks, took the twenty, and left his change in front of him on the bar. “Hey there, Santa. Buy a girl a drink?” “Yeah, and what are you, darling? Naughty or nice?” “I’ve always thought I was a little of both.” “Ha. What’s your name, baby?” “Sandra. They call me Sandy around here. But I think of myself as Sandra.” “All right, Sandra. What’s your story?” “Just a local girl, been in the same place too long. What about you, Santa? Don’t you gotta lot of work to do tonight?” Caleb laughed, that deep, reassuring laugh he’d mastered over the years, to put people—women especially—at ease. They talked for a while. Then Caleb ordered a pitcher of beer and a couple more shots and they moved to a corner booth. Sandra talked on and on, chain smoking Salems while he drank his beer and sipped his whiskey, watching as the room began to spin in slow, psychedelic and nauseating circles. “You’re awful quiet.” “I’ve been told that before.” “How’d you get them scars on your neck?” Caleb put his hand to his neck, let it drift down to the dirty fake beard, and pulled the knotted grey and black mess of hair over to cover his throat. And that wicked Ghost of Christmas Past with sunken eyes and yellow teeth whispered, “Tell her.” And so Caleb did. “In the war.” “You were over in ‘Nam, huh?” “Yeah, two tours.” They grew quiet. “So, you going to tell me about those scars, or what?” “Well, I was a Kootchie Kootie. A tunnel rat. You know what that is?” “Oh, yeah. You were one of those guys that go down in those gook holes?” “Oh, baby. You was attacked by an animal down in one of those tunnels?” “You brought something back with you? You mean like that agent orange stuff, honey?” “No, something different. Something, something. . .” “Oh, baby, oh, baby, I understand.” The room was twirling now at a breakneck speed. He was going to be sick. He pulled away from her and vomited on the floor. “Son of a bitch!” the bartender shouted. “Who’s going to clean that up?” Caleb hung over the edge of the booth, retching and dry heaving. “Fuck you, Sam. He’s a veteran! He fought for this country, got attacked down in one of them gook holes. What the fuck you ever done?” “I don’t care if he was on the beach at Normandy. Get him the fuck out of here!” “You’re a piece of work. A real piece of work, know that, Sam? Where’s your sense of Christmas spirit?” We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. “How you feeling, Santa?” “Good. I feel . . .” he paused, unsure what to say, how he actually felt. “Good.” She knelt down beside the tub, ran her finger over the surface of the water. “Thirsty?” she asked, holding up a tumbler of Scotch and water. “As a matter of fact, I am.” Taking the glass into his hands, he took a sip. Handing it back to her she gave him a penetrating stare that he found hard to decipher and then leaned in to kiss him. She tasted of whiskey, cigarettes and peppermint. But it was good, the way she gently ran her tongue over his upper lip before she pulled away, and Caleb felt himself growing aroused. “Now that you’re all cleaned up, why don’t we get you to bed.” “Sounds good, baby.” “Dry yourself off. I’ll be waiting.” With that she disappeared out the door. He gave her a questioning half grimace and then smiled. “You serious?” “I told you: I gotta thing for Santa.” “Oh, yeah, baby. I’ve been so naughty. I need to be punished.” With that she burst out in playful laughter, turned over onto all fours, and stuck her ass into the air, whispering over her shoulder, “Come and get it, Santa.” He approached the bed and, still standing, he pulled himself into her. She let out a deep moan and he began to move, slowly. He was still drunk as hell and the room was spinning slightly but he could feel that primal urge within to rock and rotate. He began to lunge faster, and faster, and then, suddenly, it was happening again. Fuck. No. No. No. It was happening again . He could feel himself beginning to change as he thrust against her. A part of him wanted to run away, to bolt through the door and into the night so that he wouldn’t hurt her. But another part of him wanted this. It felt good. It felt so fucking good to let go and let the animal inside him take over. Still pounding, Sandra moaning beneath him, he watched in wonder as his fingers—tightly gripping her bony hips—became claws and a thick mat of fur began to weave itself up his arms. Thrusting against her with all his might he lifted his face and began to howl as his mouth filled with sharp, gleaming fangs. Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus lane! From his bedroom window her grandson Tommy watched the entire thing. God, the Easter Bunny, and the Ghost of Christmas Present watched as two-year-old Annabelle toddled out the door of her street-level apartment and onto the sidewalk, a thumb stuck in her mouth and dragging a Barbie doll along by the hair. God looked like the guy from the Dos Equis commercials: an incredibly good looking older gentleman with white hair, perfectly coifed, and a nicely trimmed beard, in a tuxedo. The Ghost of Christmas Present looked extremely bored and kept yawning. The Easter Bunny was an out-of-work writer who needed a shave, dressed in a pink bunny outfit. “Cute kid,” the Easter Bunny commented. “I wouldn’t get too attached,” the Ghost of Christmas Present replied, disinterestedly stifling a yawn. Annabelle’s parents were fighting again and they could all hear their voices echoing out from the apartment. “Just how many Quaaludes did you take? You can’t even look at me. Jesus, wake up, bitch, I’m talking to you.” “Fuck off, Henry. You always were a bore.” “You dumb c*nt. I oughta slap the stupid right offa your face.” When the wolf came galloping down the middle of the street in its blood soaked Santa suit the Easter Bunny turned to God and said, “You gotta be putting me on, man.” God rolled his eyes. “It’s probably for the best,” the Ghost of Christmas Past said. “What? Why?” the Easter Bunny asked, scratching at the stubble on his face. “You want to tell him, God? Or should I?” “Is this true?” the Easter Bunny asked God. God grinned and nodded. “You don’t say much, do you?” the Easter Bunny asked God. God just shrugged. Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la. ‘Tis the season to be jolly, fa la la la la la la la la. Father Mulligan was cleaning up after midnight mass when he heard the click-clack of claws on the wooden floor. He paused, chalice in one hand, ciborium in the other, and listened. “Hello?” he called out, his voice echoing throughout the empty chapel. “Who’s there?” Beneath the pounding of blood in his ears he distinctly heard panting, like that of a large animal. “Hello?” The Ghost of Christmas Present laughed heartily. “Well, I hate to say I told you so, but . . .” Joy to the world, the Lord has come. Let Earth receive her king! The Easter Bunny, who wasn’t even wearing his rabbit outfit anymore, and was now just dressed in his usual black jeans and t-shirt, was pacing back and forth irritably. He turned to the Ghost of Christmas Present and asked, slightly argumentatively, “Well, where’s God?” “A concert? What are you talking about?” “Well, it was Skynard and you know how he loves Free Bird.” “Hey there, beautiful,” she said. The wolf just stared at her with its unblinking yellow eyes. The beast crawled atop her and slipped itself into her. When it shuddered and released itself inside her she knew within her heart that she would be with child. This was a happy moment. A glorious moment in time. Another Christmas miracle. Oh, joyous night. She would name this child Stewart, Stewart Kirby, after her grandfather. Afterwards, the beast lay against her, spent. She stroked its fur with her nails and gently kissed its blood drenched snout. In this way the beast kept the girl warm through the coldest hours of the night. Silent Night. Holy Night. All is calm. All is bright. Free in the moonlight as snow began to fall, bathed in the stink of congealing human blood, the taste of flesh and woman fresh on its lips and tongue, the lycanthrope ran, the stars above him a smear of spilled milk, the moon a cataract eye aglow in malignancy. On the First Day of Christmas my true love gave to me. . . And you let go of that aching, awful, agonizing pain of being a man of flesh and blood, the cold slowing down your heart, and give in to death. And as you slip away, into the embrace of the Ghost of Christmas Future, you wonder, “Was it real? Was any of it real at all?” And in the heavens a laughing God finally breaks his silence and answers: “There is no such thing as real. It’s all just a dream within a dream.”"}

There were so many boxes. Just so, so many. I poked around in them. Old hats, baby clothes, broken toys, and finally, old, childhood books. I started taking them out of the box, one by one, paying attention to the titles so I wouldn't miss 'Rapunzel'. And there, at the very bottom of the box, was the old picture book lost in a mess of mess. I looked over it carefully. The gold tin lining around the outside of the book was torn and dull, and the cover was damp and dirty, but it seemed as if the pages inside of it were perfectly clean. So I took the book back upstairs, not bothering to clean up the other books, and ran to my room. I shut the book and stepped out of my closet, and into the safety of my warm bed. The book sat straight across from me, and, being so afraid of it, I threw one of my pillows at it. It fell over, revealing the torn back cover with words that I could barely understand even though they were so big. I couldn't look at that book ever again. I wrapped it in paper and folded it into five plastic bags, and hid it in the darkest corner of my basement. I never wanted to see that menacing little goblin ever again. I'm not sure, but when thinking about it, he may have been taking me to hell. The dream alone was just awful, but this element alone is so dark and creepy. I also remember there was another version of the dream, where I get out to the car before my family leaves, and they bring me with them. And when I look out the car window, there was the little goblin. Only he wasn't cackling—he was just staring at me with those terrible eyes. And he wasn't happy."}

Shortly after her father’s death, the nightmares began. These were not your everyday nightmares. Not the usual falling, finding yourself in school in your underwear, no. Willow seemed to be completely paralyzed. She couldn’t move or try to touch anything. The whole time she was dreaming everything was disturbingly silent for the most part, except for the occasional blood curdling scream. When she saw him in the nightmares, it always seemed like he was among the worst of the disfigured; sometimes looking like he was run over by a train or murdered with a chainsaw; but she could always see that scar. She also would see some of her acquaintances that Willow ran into from time to time, the checkout girl at the local convenience store, an elderly man she saw at church, a handful of her classmates, but no one she knew particularly well. Then she turned seventeen. The night before that particular birthday, the nightmares were particularly horrifying, the images even more vivid. She emerged from sleep with a jolt, tears streaming down her face. Willow lifted the covers off of her with trembling hands, almost losing her balance as she stepped on the ground. One hour later, the high school girl boarded the train that she took every day. Taking a seat, she noticed that Jonathan wasn’t there. She saw only his mother, who seemed to be sobbing to herself. Concerned, she walked up to her. “Miss, I know I don’t know you too well but I’ve seen you around. May I ask what’s wrong?” The Voice of the mother surrounded her, as this poor woman was frantically asking if she was okay. It’s not every day some high school girl has a mental break down on a train. Willow snaps out of her panic attack, and faces the woman. “Sweet heart, are you okay?” She said. Willow nearly dropped her textbook right in the middle of the hallway. She was understandably beginning to panic. This was getting too weird to be a simple coincidence. It was clear that there was some correlation between her dreams and the chain of events that were occurring before her very eyes. She knew one thing: Today was going to be a sick day. She walked to the office, shaking. The nurse turned to face her. “What’s wrong, Willow?” She said, concerned. She was one of those people in the school that knew everyone’s name. “You don’t feel warm…” She said, skeptical “but I can see you need to go home” Before she knew it, the night rolled around. This time the dream was about that guy from her church; seventy-something William, the next night, her neighbor, fourteen-year old Joel. Then, out of nowhere, something terrifying happened on the third night. “Where am I? Please, someone help me, please!” Much to her surprise, she was answered. “Who are you?” She shrieked, “Where am I? Please, let me go!” “My dear Willow” he came over to her, and graced the bottom of her chin with his ice-cold, bony fingers. “Now I can’t let you go so soon. I haven’t even gotten to fix you yet.” The disturbing thing about his words was the warmth in them, despite the dark, morbid meaning. He spoke like a loving father, comforting his child. “You must have seen this coming, I have been warning you for more than a year now.” “Warning? How?” He chuckled. “You really did think those were dreams, didn’t you?” “See here young Willow, it’s not too hard to drug someone. I would simply give you enough of the drug to paralyze and confuse you, take you with me, and put you back. I did this with a few other people too; I think you may recognize a few of them. But then there were the times I got a bit… carried away.” He chuckled again and motioned towards the bodies. “But some of those people, they were murdered! And then they were fine, I saw them again later!\" “Well I didn’t take you here every night dear. I wouldn’t doubt that you did actually dream about it sometimes. The mind is a funny thing.” He grinned in the most disturbing fashion Willow has ever seen. “You haven’t taken off your tank top in awhile, have you?” He said. “What did you do ?!” She screamed “My father?” “See here, when we were in our twenties, we worked together at a factory. You were a newborn then, and you were the most beautiful girl. It was a very modest job, but he did what he could to provide for you. We weren’t the best of friends, but we were friends. No problems.” He paused, turned away and grimaced. “Then one day, oh that one day, there was a massive fire in that factory. Willow closed her eyes as the man laid her on the wooden plank and strap down her limbs in a fashion similar to the old medieval torture method known as “the rack”. “I’m sorry we have to spend our last moments like this, Willow. But it must be done. The only reason is that you have impurities caused by him. You have too much of your father in you. I know you’re scared, but I know what’s best.” He reached into the pocket of his hardly-intact jeans and pulled out a sharp, surprisingly clean scalpel. “Now keep in mind, he’s leaving you. You’re going to be better soon.” Without saying another word, he stuck the scalpel into the young girl’s arm. She cried into the empty air in agonizing pain, tears streaming down her face. He put a hand gently over her mouth. “Let him leave you.” He repeated the process with the other arm. He ran his fingers through her hair; to sooth her in some twisted way. “I can be with you now, Willow, forever…”"}

My boy and ANTRAN were knelt down on the rug, play fighting with one another, as boys do. Suddenly, my attention was drawn to a loud gasp. I looked down and saw my child gripping his arm. He rolled up his sleeve. On his skin was a large, red mark covering his forearm. “ANTRAN pinched me,” he replied, in a shaky voice. A few weeks later, my child came into my room. It must have been early morning. My slumber was interrupted by the gentle creaking of my bedroom door. “Yes, son?” I replied. “It keeps looking at me.” “What? What does?” I asked him, through tired eyes. “ANTRAN. He keeps looking at me, at the end of my bed.” His voice trembled, fearful. I could tell something wasn’t right. I noticed him rubbing his other arm and immediately called him over. Pulling up his sleeve, my heart sank. More bruises. Must have been four or five, all the way up his small arms. I shouted at the top of my lungs for the being, looking under the bed and out the closed bedroom window. Suddenly, there was a loud knock from above us, then hard footsteps. “It’s in the loft,” I whispered, my eyes to the heavens. It was a September dawn; I was sat in my armchair drinking when I heard the pantry door creak open. Again, nothing. Except there on the kitchen counter was ANTRAN'S favourite red toy car.

Its glass was cracked, but it appeared to still be usable. As I reach out for my only source of light in this dark place, I notice my strange clothing. I was wearing a long, light blue and lavender, Gothic Victorian styled dress. It was tattered around the waist, and was missing sleeves, but seemed to fit well. I take a step back from the large door, contemplating my next move. Out of the corner of my eye, I could have sworn I just saw one of the old, dusty curtains close abruptly as I take notice of my surroundings. Was someone inside, watching me? That seems to be the only explanation. But then again, it could have been my corrupt mind playing tricks on me. That's when I notice it. Alongside the dark stone wall, just out of reach, was an assortment of thick vines. If I could find a way to grab onto them, I'd be able to climb my way up the wall, and finally get inside this building. But why do I want to even get inside? Any sane person would immediately turn away at the sight of the mansion, but I chose to find a way in... Perhaps I'm not sane. I'm not sure why, but there is just something about this place... It feels like I need to be here. To be within the walls, to find a purpose of why I ended up here. Grimacing, I take hold of the handle and pull open the heavy door. In front of me was a long, dark hallway, only lit by a few torches that were very sparsely placed along the walls. The hall was also eerily cold, and I could see my shattered breaths before me, floating in the air and slowly dissipating like a ghost. \"Don't let her escape...\" A small whimper emits from my throat and I begin to shiver. What now? I could hide, but I know nothing about this old building. I could try to escape, but I'd have nowhere to go even if I somehow succeeded. As I stand there, I hear a loud growl from somewhere behind me. I turn around once again and my limbs go numb. I couldn't move, I couldn't do anything. All I could do was stand motionless and in horror, staring wide eyed at the horrid creature before me. He continued getting closer, and closer, until he was merely a few feet in front of me. He reaches out, and my limp fingers drop my lantern. It crashes to the floor, the glass breaking into a million pieces. All the lights in the hall burn out, and I'm left with no sense of sight whatsoever. I scream out in tears as I feel a sharp pain make its way through my abdomen, and a warm fluid that I can only imagine was my blood drips from the wound and down my waist. I fall to the floor and curl up into a ball, near death. The last thing I see is an old man carrying a torch enter the hall, an evil grin across his face."}

I nodded towards the Priest as he walked to me and simply said, “Father.” I've never been a religious man myself so I wasn't sure if there was anything else I should say or not so I stood there feeling uncomfortable about the whole situation. The priest spoke to me, “Son, what is to happen here tonight must never be spoken of. Doctor Hemmerman has told me that I could trust that of you, is that so?” “Yes Father, but what..” that was as far as I got before he walked past me into the room and firmly shut the door. At first everything was quiet for the first time that night, all I could hear was the tapping of the rain against the metal roof of the center. The thunder seemed to have calmed and if the patient was still making noise it did not penetrate through the thick wooden door."}

Not like a bird, singing a happy tune in the orange sky, but real whistling. HUMAN whistling. I went out of the tent with the lantern, my hand shaking slightly, to see where it was coming from. I looked forward. My house's lights were getting nowhere near where we were. I looked to the left. Nothing but grass and trees in the distance. I looked to the right. It got slightly louder. I shined the light in that direction. I saw nothing but trees and grass. I thought I could slightly see the outline of some sort of animal near the trees. The woods were at least two hundred meters away so I couldn't tell what it was. All I saw was that it was on four legs. For some reason I decided to whistle back. I whistled a simple, very short tune and just stood there...waiting for something to happen. And sure enough as soon as I started to go back in the tent, I heard the thing answer. And it wasn't random. It mimicked the sound perfectly. There was no fucking way it echoed. It was too far away to echo. “What the hell?” Jake said quietly. “What the hell is this?” I said."}

Be as specific and detailed as possible.” Look, I’m going to make this as quick as possible for the obvious reasons. I will give my version of events for why I was fired and you’re going to do your damndest to try and get me my severance package or at least something to keep me going in-between jobs. How does that sound? Do we have a deal? Christine arrived and was taken up to the OR wing of the hospital. This wasn’t because she needed surgery, but because the OR was shut down on the weekends. I always assumed it was closed because the surgeons wanted some time to play a round of eighteen holes on the weekend without having to worry about checking in on their wards. She was brought into the OR because there weren’t a whole lot of people there and it would be easier to keep all non-essential personnel out of the way. She started to cry and there wasn’t a single thing I could think of to say to calm her down other than, “It’s over.” He kept pressing and eventually I relented under the condition that I stay in the room while he was there. I brought him into the room and he stood over the broken body of his girl. It looked like he could barely contain himself at the sight of her injuries, but he managed to keep himself under control. As she was unconscious, there wasn’t much he could do or say to her. He stroked the side of her face and then sat down next to me. We sat in silence for five minutes before he struck up a conversation with me. He told me that his wife would be here shortly. We talked a little more. It was mainly small talk. I can’t even remember what we talked about exactly. He was more focused on Christine than talking, but I think he felt uncomfortable with the silence. I don’t have an exact time, but I think we probably dragged the conversation on for an hour or so. It was around 7:30 when Christine started to come to from the sedative. She spoke in a whisper, but it felt like she was shouting the words right into my ears, “It was him. ” I croaked, “What did he tell you?” She looked up at me and in that moment her eyes were as wide as saucers. She said, “He told me that he ‘loved the time we spent together. And that we should do it ag-’” The rest of the words caught in her throat, and she broke down wailing and weeping. My boss arrived at around that time and I was fired almost on the spot. That’s my story. I know I messed up, but how could I have known who that guy was? Well now that I say it all out loud, I guess I really was in the wrong on this. I doubt I’m going to get a termination package. This trip out here was a waste of time, well not completely, maybe I’ll go give Christine a visit… Why are you looking at me like that? What’s going on here? This whole interview thing wasn’t about my severance or wrongful termination. This interview was about Christine! Oh God, is she all right? “Christine has been missing since last night. We have no clue where she could be.”"}

For those of you not in the know, camp tax is essentially where the unit would place all the shitbags such as myself to do bitch work around the cantonment area. Picking up trash, cleaning toilets, working in the chow hall, and other such tasks. I walked back to my tent and right away I knew something was wrong. My tent was open. I scurried over and looked inside. My cigarettes were gone. Fucking thieves, I thought. As I pondered what I was going to do, I heard laughter. I glanced over in the direction where it came from, and I saw Davidson standing in the smoke pit, smoking a cigarette. I knew for a fact that he ran out of smokes a week ago, and no one here liked him enough to give him one of theirs. Rage growing inside of me, I stomped towards him. In hindsight, I could have handled that better. I won’t go into too much detail, but the situation ended with Davidson being taken back to cantonment to see the Corpsman and me being put on firewatch all night. I was going to have firewatch for multiple hours every night for the rest of the time we were out there. Fuck. It was a little awkward at first, having to spend several hours every night walking around in a circle with a guy I knocked out, but after a while the awkwardness dissipated, and soon we were talking and laughing like old friends. Him bringing me a pack of Marlboros to make up for the one he stole certainly helped. More days pass, more maimed goats, their corpses inching closer and closer to our sanctuary. During our watch, me and Davidson would try and see what was causing the depopulation of the local goat community, but we never could. It was too dark, our tiny flashlights only shone so far, and our NVGs were back in the armory in cantonment. It was a complete mystery to us, until one night. During our watch, we were talking, just shooting the shit, when we heard a shrill scream. It sounded just like a person. We both jumped and spun toward the direction of the scream. We both let out a sigh of relief to see it was just a goat, standing on a hill, illuminated by the moonlight, about twenty meters away from us. Those old YouTube videos are right; a goats scream sounds just like a human. All day the next day, we begged Sergeant Hart not to put us on watch outside the perimeter of the AHA. We argued that it was unnecessary from a security standpoint, as there was a tall fence that surrounded the AHA. He told us that he didn’t care, and that it was our punishment for fighting each other and embarrassing him. We then offered to stand firewatch the whole night, every night, for the last few days we were here, just behind the fence. Me and Davidson both sighed in relief when he agreed to those terms. Everything went to shit on that last night. “What do you mean, he’s gone?” Sergeant Hart barked at the young PFC. “I-I don’t know, Sergeant! I looked inside his tent to get him for his watch, and he was gone!” The PFC stuttered back. “Great, this is the last fucking thing I needed.” Sergeant Hart growled. He than turned to me and said “You, Davidson, and PFC Dumbass here are going to go find him and bring him back.” I immediately objected. “Sergeant, you can’t be serious, it’s the middle of the night, it’s dark as fuck out, and we don’t know which way he went! We need to call this in!” I didn’t mention the real reason I didn’t want to go, because I knew he still didn’t believe me. “Fuck no!” Sergeant Hart snapped. “If I call this into the COC, I’m fucked, which by extension, means you’re all fucked. Shit rolls downhill!” “Echo Five Hotel, this is- “ “Fuck!” I exclaimed angrily. I exchanged a glance with Davidson. “Did uh, you happen to bring an extra battery?” I asked. “He’s right.” Davison chimed in. “If Sergeant doesn’t hear back from us, he’ll be more pissed than before.” “Alright, let’s get- “ “When we get back to the AHA, I’m personally going to fuck you up, then Sergeant Hart’s going to fuck you up, and then when we get back to cantonment, I’m going to- “ “Where’s Scott?” Davidson panted. “It fucking killed him!” I gasped back “Hart should have let us bring our fucking rifles!” Davidson angrily exclaimed. Davidson tried to convince Sergeant Hart to let us bring our rifles and some ammunition, but he refused, he didn’t want to risk us losing them or having a negligent discharge. He insisted that if there was something out there, it probably wouldn’t bother us. He was a Sergeant, so he knew better than us. “Oh my god, fuck…” He panted. “I can’t go on, I can’t breathe…” I stopped and screamed at him. “Davidson get the hell up! We’re almost there!” “I can- I can’t breathe…” “Throw me on you-your back and carry me.” All he told me about the creature I saw was that they were aware of its existence and that the situation was under control. I kept in contact with a few of the guys who were there that night. Surprisingly, most are still in the fleet and are now NCO’s. We didn’t really talk about what happened, most of them didn’t really get the whole story. The whole real story anyway. As the weeks went on, I kept seeing obituaries and memorial posts popping up, all for the guys who were at the AHA that night. The causes of death were all crazy things; car accidents, training accidents, undiagnosed medical conditions, stuff like that. By my count, I’m the only one left, which is why I’m writing this. I don’t think I have much time left. For the past few days, I’ve been locked in my room. I’m afraid to go outside. I’m being watched. From my window I can occasionally see a black van drive by, I know it’s the same one every time from the license plate, and I swear I can hear a helicopter fly by every so often. Helicopters have never flown by my apartment before last week. I’m praying to God that this is all just one big coincidence and that I’m just losing my mind. What I do know that if this is all real, I’m not going let them make my death look like an accident. I am perfectly healthy, I don’t have any dangerous hobbies, and my job isn’t dangerous. I am not planning on hurting myself. If they come for me, I’m going to fight. They won’t be able to make it look like an accident."}

It seems to be a case of self-mutilation, but why would the victim -and I say victim because I’m still not convinced, have a reason to do this to herself?” Nothing? She thought, confused. Then she picked up the pillow and tried to see where it was, if it were there at all. The warm sweat and drool on her pillow moistened her hand and as the thirsty winds fed on the moisture; she felt cold. She felt with her free hand for her cell-phone. There! She found it. Good, well. Isabella could still feel her salivary glands pouring thick, water-deficient saliva into her mouth. Perhaps a little more. This time she was careful to drink slower. She filled her stomach with water until she could feel the unease of a strange wobble inside. Now all she wanted was to go back to her bedroom and sleep; okay, stay awake and be quiet about it. She must have woken up someone with the racket she created while she switched on all the appliances. The golden glow of the microwave stared back at her under the flutter of the ceiling-fan, bathed in another glow that was the local lights. She found herself pressing again, at the other end. Light was back from the CFL. And now she sat again, on the stool, waiting patiently for the night to end, and despising guests. “By the state of her body, she couldn't have possibly done it herself,” he said in a single breath as he stared into the picture at last, disturbed by it but also too stupefied to look away at this point of time. “And why do you think so?” Cathleen stepped into the darkness to let him have a complete view. She suppressed a smile, for she knew exactly why he thought so. “Mum, mum wake up!” Beatrice shook her mother’s shoulder as she slept. It was very early in the morning and Beatrice’s mother was not excited about the fact that she was being woken up, but sensing the emotion in her daughter’s voice, she did so anyway. “What is it, Bea?” “It’s Isabella. She’s awake.” Hearing this, Martha mother was mildly annoyed. She knew her older daughter to be an insomniac, especially while under the pressure of coming exams. And thus the situation was explained. “Answer me,” she demanded. Isabella turned to her mother, slowly, mechanically. Her eyes were dark and dull. She broke into a straight, fake smile after what felt like a lifetime. “Why wouldn't I be?” “Why wouldn't you what.” “Be alright. Why wouldn't I be alright?” \"That's because I was.\" “And just how would you know that.” Martha sat back and crossed her hands, silently checking her own pulse and willing it to be slower. “You are scared. And yet you refuse to believe it.” “BELIEVE WHAT.” “Are you going to cry? I’m sorry if I’m making you cry.” Inside the bathroom, the older sister looked for a while, and when she found not what she sought, she walked out again, this time, glaring at Beatrice and flashing her a short, sharp smile. Bea, the little clumsy girl, was now chewing her hand, but not really getting anywhere. She would need sharper teeth than that, her sister thought as she left the room. That gave her an idea. But then WHERE did her father keep his stupid razors?! “Isabella, hon, what are you doing?” “Nothing, father, just go back to bed. You’re safe in bed.” Turning around, he checked the clock. It seemed to be stuck, and the hour’s hand moved back and forth from 3 to 4, visibly fast. Samuel stared at it for a while, feeling oddly dizzy. The bathroom door slammed shut. It stung, it hurt, but that was okay. Flakes of enamel fell into the sink, with a little blood, too. This did not concern Isabella as she chipped off further, staring right into the bathroom mirror as she did. She knew that it would all soon be worth it, in a while. “They seemed to be in it together, but nobody was there in the bathroom with her.” “How do you know? Harris just said that it wasn't suicide. It could have been her family members, most likely her father,” another officer pointed out. “It wasn't.” “What makes you so sure?” somebody asked. She sighed. “Well, whatever it was, it was contagious. Her sister, Beatrice her name is, is in care right now; they’re trying to keep her from nibbling at her hand. Her mother hasn't ceased crying, and the only person who can talk is the father. It’s clear that he’s in shock too, but he seems to be convincing himself that he saw somebody inside. No traces were found though, not even fingerprints.”' “So someone could have been there?” “I have interviewed everyone related to the crime scene. I can assure you that the possibilities of a person being there are few.” “What other information have you gained from the interviews?” “What did he say?” Cathleen pressed a button on the remote. “… Something downright frightening.” “WHAT,” she shouted back, “do you want?” “Open the door. NOW!” “I’m bathing,” she gurgled through the blood. “OPEN THE DOOR ISABELLA.” “This is what he said he saw.” The lieutenant paused. She believed in a snappy briefing and even quicker justice, but here she felt like a person narrating a story as the listeners sat around a camp-fire and ate burnt marshmallows. “Artist: Isabella Smith, and one hell of an artist too. Object: her imaginary friend from long ago.” A little girl with a triangular body and crooked lines for limbs, holding the hand of a grown man with a scar across his eye; the same strange man in the middle of the playground, out of place in the whole picture; a forest with the same little girl walking with the man, but she did not seem so happy; her in chains, very detailed chains, with the man sitting there, just staring; herself again, disembodied with several faceless kids glaring down at her flesh and pieces. Each drawing was better than the last, and finally the same one again, with the man at the bath-tub, his scar fresher than ever. Inside, Isa wondered why he bothered at all. What was done was done. She just hoped the lock would not break before she could finish, that it would not fail her in this lifetime. Haha, a lock with a life. Funny. The projector screeched. The slides started to play again, from the beginning. This, Cathleen thought, was not part of the briefing, or rather, story. She pressed frantically at the buttons on the remote, and finally after several failures, she walked up to the switch and pressed the reverse end of all switches. The air was filled with a burning smell; the projector was destroyed. And suddenly, there was darkness. Suddenly only darkness. The man at the bathtub greeted Isabella’s father with a smile. It seemed that the case was Isabella’s and hers alone."}

Dick, A Scanner Darkly The only reason I came to Seattle was because of all the great job opportunities after college, but like all my other plans, things didn’t go the way I’d hoped. But out of all the stuff I’d be doing tonight, there was one thing I was looking forward to even more. This girl I like, Reyane, will be tagging along with the rest of us. And who knows, maybe if I make a good impression on her, next time it might just be the two of us? About 30 minutes before I was supposed to leave, I was in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, enjoying the thought that soon I’d be at the movies with everyone. I’m staring into the mirror, brushing each tooth individually, counting each stroke, kind of like in that movie... what was it called? “Stranger Than Fiction”? Yeah, that was it. I’m nowhere near as insane as Will Ferrell is though. As I continue brushing my teeth, I get a sudden chill. Have you ever gotten the feeling that you were being watched? Like someone was right behind you without you knowing? Like anyone would do, I take a look around me just to make sure that I wasn’t being watched, even though I knew no one was. It’s like getting soap in your eye while taking a shower, you close your eyes for a few seconds, but then get the feeling someone is behind the curtain. There were a group of teenagers hanging out near the entrance to the complex, and my neighbor’s dog was barking like crazy. It does that whenever it sees people it doesn’t recognize. It gets annoying at times, because despite the few people that live in this building, we get a lot of visitors. Sometimes the dog will wake me up at night when a group of joggers jog past. Reyane comes up to me, noticing my expression. “Scared?” she says as she smiles and walks towards the theater. I knew I couldn’t pass off this eerie feeling, cause now I’m more paranoid than ever. I’ve never been the biggest fan of fog. Tons of accidents happen due to the idiot drivers who forget to turn on their lights and end up colliding with another car. But driving alone in the fog after watching a horror movie can make you paranoid beyond belief. Did you ever watch the television series, “The Twilight Zone”? I distinctly remember an episode about a girl who decided to take a trip across the states, and there would always be a man popping up everywhere, just out of the blue. There, sitting in the back, was a man. At least, I think it was a man. He was covered in a silhouette of darkness, but the figure looked like that of a male. For 10 seconds, I just stared. I couldn’t speak, move, or even breathe. I just looked into the mirror and watched as the man sat there silently. I quickly turned around, only to find nothing but empty fast food bags and other garbage. This was getting out of hand. I couldn’t handle what was going on, my mind couldn’t comprehend what was happening. It wasn’t my brain's fault. I can’t blame it on being tired anymore, because at that moment, I was wide awake. And all I could think about was getting home as soon as possible. I sped up, and in a matter of minutes, I was home. I checked in my side-view mirror this time, and about 30 feet away, I saw a distinct figure walking slowly to my car. I got out of the car as fast as I could, and bolted up the stairs to my floor. I look over the railing. This time I knew he was real. I see him by the car, slowly walking towards the stairs. He was after me. I started pounding on all my neighbors’ doors, begging for help, but no one came to help me. I looked over my shoulder; the man was walking up the stairs. I ran to my door, bolted into my apartment, slammed the door shut, got into my closet, and just waited. It felt like an eternity. I waited in that closet, hoping for some sign that I would be okay. I heard the neighbor’s dog barking outside my apartment, and that can only mean it sees the man as well. Hearing this meant that I was not going crazy; he is, in fact, real. What was going to happen to me? Was he going to kill me? The footsteps stopped right outside my front door and I realize something..."}

I'm twenty years old, and I want to tell you about an \"accident\" that happened about ten years ago. And boy, was I wrong. So, it was a normal, boring day in class. Math, Lunch/Recess, Literacy, Social Studies, more Math, Lunch/Recess, art, then the end of the day. But, at the end of the day, we were asked to put these forms in our planners. They were forms, for a play. We could \"audition and have the time of your life, or stay at home doing nothing but play video games.\" I, as a ten year old \"cool kid\" wanted to boast about being the only person in the class to go to the play. All of my friends said, \"That's your choice,\" and I'd just say \"Yes, it is.\" Three weeks later, it was finally time. My parents drove me to the auditioning place, I did my act, and I did good. I passed. He said to wait another week and your parents/guardian would drive you to the theater. One week was like one years at that point, so I just did normal things until that time. On Monday, after school, my mom drove me to the play. The outside looked like shit, but the inside looked beautiful. I was in the backstage, getting my costume on. Twenty-three minutes later, when all the people arrived, they play started. I can't remember what it was about, due to things that you will hear later in the story. Only thirty-two more minutes. I was having the time of my life, performing, and the main character was talking to me, when suddenly, the lights went out. I tried to look for a source of light, but couldn't find one. I heard a scream, near me. The lights went back on. A hideous shriek was heard, and I covered my ears the second it started. I hear a noise. I ran around and the lights came back on. I puked at what I saw. Something, pure white. With organs, intestines, hell, even kidneys all over it. Still no blood. I ran out of the stage room, and went into the lobby. I heard a loud scream, but not from just one person, it sounded like half of the audience. I went outside, and found my mom waiting in the car. I cried, and begged her to take me home. She put me in the car, I buckled my self in, and we drove off. And, when we were driving, I saw the same creature. Pointing at me. I have recovered from the incident since then, but I can still remember it. Sometimes I wonder where that creature is right now. Is it outside my home? Or watching me when I sleep? I don't know, but I always know, that no matter where I am, it will point at my direction. Or directly at me."}

I took martial arts", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Beings"], "content": "The first time climbing that mountain was a huge breath of fresh air. I felt that cool spring morning breeze, and I saw the waist-high yellow grass swaying in the wind. I heard my feet stomping against the thin dirt trail, and the sound of birds chittering nearby. It felt like heaven. I remember reaching the top of the hill, out of breath and sweating all over. It was an uncomfortable reminder of just how unfit I was, but was quickly swept away as I began to take in the view. From the summit, I could see almost the entire town below. It hit me then. Now that I was sixteen, that entire town was open to me. It felt huge and miniscule simultaneously, as I also considered the size of the outside world. That changed everything. Suddenly, I was outside daily. Not only was I getting stronger, but I was thoroughly enjoying every single moment of it. That hill almost became my home away from home, in fact. Every day I’d stomp my way to the top, only to make my way back down again. All the while, I listened to the noises of the mountain. There were very many of them, in fact, there were more than one like myself might initially expect. I doubt I’ve even heard them all. That was my first time encountering a predator. That type of encounter--that type of noise--is one that leaves a lasting impression. Even when the creature isn’t large enough to eat you, knowing that something with the ability to severely wound you lurks just out of sight is a terrifying feeling. Back then, I didn’t immediately register that a rattlesnake was making that noise, or how close exactly it was, but I knew just from that sound that the best thing to do was to simply back away. Predators are frightening creatures, and their presence should put anyone on edge. Healthy fear is a wise thing to have. I no longer hike there. I no longer hike anywhere, for that matter. Nobody questions me when I stubbornly refuse. I never go out at night anymore, either. I did once, and that alone scared me away from it. Well, for a year or so, at least. Whenever I went out at night, no matter where I was, I began to hear those screams again. They would start low, then begin to rise. It shouldn’t be possible. I’m deaf now. But that never stops them. I regret everything, now. I regret so much as stepping outside. I’m miserable, and nobody can console me. Do you have any idea what it’s like to live without noise? Especially when you can vividly remember every sound from when you could still hear? It’s disturbing, to say the absolute least. Doctors tried everything, of course, but nothing worked in the end. It’s utterly miserable. That’s why I’m outside writing this. The screams are getting louder and louder, and I see shapes shifting in the dark. I think they’re coming for me, but I never really knew if they would kill me, or if they just wanted to taunt me. Maybe I’m just going insane. Nevertheless, I can’t go on like this. I think I’ll wait for now, and see what they do. Before, I was too scared to find out, but not anymore. And if these really are my last moments, well… at least it won’t be silent."}

He would grab his shotgun and go out into the woods almost every day. When Thomas would get back, they would eat whatever game Thomas could find. Johnny always wanted to go hunting with his father, but Thomas said that it was dangerous to go out into the woods. One day Johnny got curious. After his father left, he decided to go out into the woods. His mother thought that he was just going to take care of the livestock. Johnny thought that his father would find him, or that his mother would call his name, \"Johnny, Johnny are you okay?\" Those words rang out in his mind like the screeching of a bobcat. Johnny didn't know where he was. Johnny was lost. He suddenly heard the snapping of a twig behind him. Johnny saw the trees looming over him, the glowing eyes of the owl staring him down. Johnny turned around as fast as a bullet. His bright blue eyes widened when he saw it. It was a humanoid squatting towards the ground. Its skin was snow white and completely hairless. It was the size of a black bear and one of its three-fingered hands was laying on top of the now broken stick. Its other hand was in mid air, as if the thing was crawling towards Johnny. The thing's face was completely blank except for a wide, gaping maw. It was standing still, like a statue. Johnny tried not to blink while backing up, slowly. It just stood there, not moving a muscle. Johnny then threw the rock to his left; it landed in a stream with a splash. The creature looked in the direction of the stream and darted towards it. Johnny got up and started to run back to the house. He didn't look back. He saw the fields of grass and the barn in the distance. He heard a loud shrill noise, louder than a mountain lion's roar. Johnny ran out of the woods and into the barn with the livestock. Johnny fell to the ground and rolled into the fetal position as some of the sheep started to panic. Betsy walked over to him cautiously, never seeing Johnny behave this this before. She mooed at the boy, trying to comfort him. Johnny looked up at Betsy and told her to stay quiet. Johnny then realized that it was dark out; it was a new moon. He laid there in the hay for what seemed like hours, with some of the hay going into his light blonde hair. He heard a growl come from the roof of the house. He saw his mother walk outside of the house with a lantern in her hand. \"Johnny, where are you?\" she asked. Johnny wanted to reply to her, but he didn't want to give away his position. The creature crawled down from the top of the roof, slowly, like a snake slithering towards a mouse. Marie walked down from the porch and called her son's name as the creature's long arm reached out towards her. Johnny and the animals silently waited for the inevitable. Johnny looked around for a rock to throw; there was nothing. Suddenly, a gunshot boomed from out in the woods. It was Thomas, alone, far out. The creature's cover was blown as it screeched and turned around as it ran off into the woods. Marie turned around as she screamed and collapsed on the ground. Johnny ran out of the barn yelling, \"Mommy!\" \"Thomas, down here!\" Marie yelled as Thomas looked down to see her under the wooden porch. Thomas then crawled under the porch and hid in the crawlspace. The creature lunged out of the woods and landed right next to the house, burying its claws in the dirt. \"Thomas, do you have the gun?\" Marie asked in a whisper. \"Oh good God, no, I don't have it,\" Thomas replied. They both knew that it was too late now. \"I shouldn't have went out at a new moon,\" he said. \"What are you talking about?\" Marie replied. \"I've seen that thing before, and I saw what it can do to deer,\" her husband whispered. \"It only comes out at new moons, so it could hunt in the darkness.\" \"Well whatever it is, I don't want it doing the same thing to us,\" Marie said. The creature scratched its long, blood red fingers against Johnny's bedroom window as the child whimpered under his bed. Its hand then suddenly broke through the glass as Johnny screamed and ran out of his room. Thomas then saw a long, rusty pole on the ground that was about five feet long. He grabbed it and crawled out from under the porch. He stood up as it started raining. He yelled at the top of his lungs, \"Hey! If you want to take my son you have to take me first!\" The creature lumbered into view. It roared at Thomas as it rushed towards him. The thing's mouth was wide open; this was Thomas' chance to strike. He ran up to the creature and rammed the pole down its throat. The creature twitched and convulsed violently as blood spurted out of its maw. The creature fell on the ground as it let out a pained gurgle."}

Dotted around the store are a bunch of mannequins wearing either fashionable clothes with children’s characters on them or costumes to be like their favorite characters. Every few weeks, the store changes. Literally, nothing stays in the same place for more than a month. The dolls can take up an entire section of a wall in one month and then occupy a small freestanding fixture the next. This means that the mannequins move around all of the time too. One night, about a month back, we broke two mannequins. Much to our dismay, and our boss's, we needed to buy a couple of new ones. Our boss was livid with us because apparently, those things cost about two grand each. Two fucking grand for a fake kid. Anyway, the two new ones arrived a few days later along with one of our deliveries for the week. I carefully picked up one of the mannequins and took it to where it would be put on display the next morning and asked one of the girls I was pulling the delivery in with to grab the other one. When I returned, I saw she was dragging this other new mannequin across the floor while still wrapped in a protective bag. “What are you doing? Just pick it up, it’s not that heavy,” I said, mockingly. “Oh, yeah? You try!” she said with a wisp of bite to her words. I left a sticky note on the thing saying to install that new mannequin first when the morning team arrived for work and that it would be at least a three-person job due to the weight and the height it needed to travel. I even questioned whether or not our glass shelving would be able to withstand the weight or not on the note. I sent a reply giving them all props for even getting the thing up there. So, he’s cashing up, one of the girls I work with is tidying the store and I’m trying to take this mannequin out of the wall, and fuck me, was I struggling. I couldn’t even detach this thing from its metal holder never mind take it down. “What the fuck?!” we both said in unison. Underneath the mannequin's face was the face of a person. Not just any person… a fucking child. I and my colleague recoiled in horror and she ran to tell the manager. He came over and looked like he’d just seen a ghost. His reaction was the most flamboyant I’ve ever seen come from him. In fact, there were targets listed on his walls. Keep your children safe, people. And next time you look at a mannequin on a shop floor or shop window. Look extra close… it might not just be a big hunk of plastic. Inside could be a whole other level of twisted."}

Finally, she could see the object the newspaper was protecting from damage: a music box. She lifted it gingerly from its resting place. It was ornately decorated. Curious, Cam lifted the lid of the box. A tiny, intricately carved ballerina stood on a little pedestal, along with a tiny key, which presumably was meant to wind it.

This is my story… It was about two weeks ago when my problems started. On my way to work, I passed a beggar on the street where I live, and he looked up at me expectantly, hoping for some charity. Ignoring him, I strolled past, but before I could go too far, he grabbed hold of my trouser leg and jerked me back. ‘Please…’ he murmured, barely audibly. Pulling myself away from his weak grasp, I said – ‘Let go, I haven’t got any money on me.’ But as he released his grip, coins chinked in my pocket. I reddened and hurried away. As I put distance between us, the beggar started cursing and he whispered something that carried on the breeze. ‘You should take a walk in the woods…’ ‘It’s coming.’ Shortly before I was discharged from hospital, I got the message that my boss was letting me off for a little while to get my problems sorted. This meant – ‘You’re fired.’ So now I’d lost my job to a stupid ghost story. Great. ‘I warned you.’ The only thing I remember is the striking pain as it bit deep into my arm. Then the blackness mercifully claimed me. But I couldn’t be sure."}

That baby isn’t even half as cute as my baby boy! ” The woman was still talking in a playful, sing-songy kind of voice, if that makes sense. She didn’t seem threatening, or creepy, she just seemed like an especially affable new mother. She kept her finger pressed to the window and brought her face up to it so her nose was just touching the glass. “ That’s my sweet, beautiful, amazing little baby boy, right…there! ” “ Is he…right there? ” my grandpa took another guess, pressing his own finger to the window. “ With the Nike hat? ” The woman took a deep breath. She started giddily stamping her feet as if she were overcome with joy. She took her finger from the glass and started clapping her hands together. “ He’s so perfect!!! Isn’t he?! Isn’t he perfect?! ” The baby in the Nike hat was me. “ Ma’am… ” my grandpa said to her, but she didn’t reply. When my grandpa told me the story (this part of which I’ve also heard from my mom separately, nearly verbatim), he said that when they realized she was all effusive over me, a newborn that wasn’t hers and didn’t have any relation to her, the woman didn’t seem delusional or confused, nor did she seem threatening or dangerous. She just seemed like a new mom, albeit an over-excited one. “ Ma’am, ” he said again. “ What? ” she said through clenched teeth. “ He’s mine. And he’s beautiful. You don’t think he’s beautiful? ” My grandpa looked at her and simply said, “ I don’t think he’s yours. “ The woman started breathing heavily, and my mom has described her as looking angrier than she’s ever seen anyone before or since. My grandpa put his arm in front of my mom and guided her backward and behind him, making sure he was between her and the woman. Then, as quickly as she’d flipped from excited to enraged, she calmed down and a warm smile crawled across her face. She kissed the tips of her fingers and pressed them to the glass once again. And with that, she turned around and walked away. Now to where I can (however vaguely) recall for myself. Due to protocol, the office workers obviously did not comply with what the woman was demanding. When one of the workers said they would call my home to get permission to release me (a ruse of course, she was going to and did call the police), the woman responded by saying, “ That beautiful baby boy only has me. He only has me and you’re trying to keep him from me. I don’t know what that beautiful child ever did to you to deserve such horrible treatment. All he wants is me, and you’re keeping him from me. He’s such a beautiful perfect baby boy and you want to hurt him! Shame on you! ” and hurried out of the school with tears running down her face. The very first letter, from my first birthday, was just a generic birthday card with the message “ To the most beautiful baby boy in the entire world. Love, your real mommy. ” By the time I was six, they’d gotten a bit more direct. “ My beautiful, perfect baby boy, I miss you and I love you so much, and I am so, SO angry that they’re keeping you away from me. I love you more than life itself, sweetheart. You are mine. ” I opened the letter I’d gotten the day prior, on my 13th birthday. Another basic birthday card, but by this point the messages were overtly threatening. “ Have a wonderful birthday, my beautiful, perfect, amazing baby boy. They will regret keeping us apart. I know you want to be with me and I know I need to be with you. We are supposed to be together, I’m your REAL mother. I love you. I love you way more than the fakes you live with now. They will regret ever stealing you from me. ” That letter too was taken to the police, but as per usual there wasn’t much to be done. The notebooks were filled front and back, cover to cover, with what were essentially ramblings about a “ beautiful baby boy ” and how he was “ going to be reunited ” with the author someday. They eventually devolved into blatant threats such as “ Everyone who keeps us apart will die. No one will be spared. We will show all of them, all of them who don’t understand us, and we will make them hurt the way they hurt us. ” Investigators spent days removing and logging all of the photos off the walls and ceilings, and even longer transcribing all of the notebooks, which, based on infrequent labellings of dates went back to 1989. June 8th, 1989 specifically. My birthday. STAY AWAY HES MY BABY BOY WHORE “ Thank you for getting rid of that nasty girl. You know I’m the only woman you need in your life, and that your REAL mother knows best. Now all you have to do is get rid of your fake mom and fake grandma and fake grandpa. I’m your REAL family. Your REAL mom. And you’re my REAL baby boy. Nothing will ever change that. I can’t wait until you come back to me. ” It was taken to the police all that, but of course, nothing was done. “ I tried accepting that the world would never let us be together. That they wanted you to stay with your fake family, and now with your whore. But I know thats not true, baby. You’re my beautiful, perfect baby boy, and I know you better than anyone knows you, and I know you need to be with me. I see you every day living your fake life and I know it’s not what you really want. I know your whole life you’ve been told that those fakes are your family, and that they are who you should love, but they are WRONG. I am who you need to love. You are MY BOY. We will be together. No matter what. I promise. I promise I will never let you go. I love you. ” I took the letter to the police, but as always, there’s only so much they can do. Since I learned what was going on, that I was being stalked, I’ve often wondered why I was chosen by this woman to be the object of her bizarre affection. What I do know is that I need to protect my mom, grandma, grandpa, and wife. I’ve been pursued by this woman since moments after I came into this world. I don’t think I’ll ever know why.

He wanted to know the The children returned from school at about three in the afternoon to end Gregory's deep slumber. He did not need an alarm for they were slamming doors and screaming at one another—as children often do. He cursed the sun, his life, and everything around him as he slowly shut the blinds. He decided to take a shower, as it would grant him a little more time to himself. Should I confront her? Will this ruin our marriage? What about the kids? His thoughts ran around that simple track for what seemed like innumerable days when his mind suddenly returned. A child's scream, preceded by the sound of shattering glass, traveled through the walls and pierced him in his confused state. He quickly shut off the now freezing water, threw on his robe and rushed down the stairs. When woken from the light, Gregory realized that he couldn't move. On a surgery table of some sort, he was held tightly in place by a series of metal bars. Round in diameter, they ran through the table to be locked at the bottom. All was dark again. This can't be true. That's my family! He could not comprehend the meaning of it all. Every moment in Gregory's life was being repeated by this dashing young man, and these photographs were hard evidence that supported it. About five feet to his right, the stranger came to stop. His breathing grew to a constant in-out tempo. Gregory heard a muffled thump and fluorescent lights came on—what he saw disturbed him: A pile of organs lay rotting on the floor. Maggots crawled through the mass of tissue in a lofty manner. They were having a feast. And even though Gregory vowed no religion, he began to pray. To whatever God was up there he begged forgiveness. And it was while he was mumbling to himself in religious ignorance that he felt a slight graze on the back of his neck. The room was dark again. He heard a door just in front of him open, and what sounded like a cage was rolled in. After a brief clashing of some keys, the cage was opened and a hissing sound could be heard. Not too long after, something long and smooth wrapped around Gregory's legs. His entire lower body began to fall asleep. Gregory's wife . The stranger whistled 'Amazing Grace' as he scalped Greg's oldest son. He worked his way down the body, stitching any possible mistakes in the formation of his new coat of skin. When he finally finished, he called the snakes back into their cage. He left the room once more, but this time he did not return. At least not for a while. The flames worked their way into the room as Gregory's youngest daughter regained consciousness. He wanted to speak but could only watch. All he could smell was burning hair as she screamed in agony. His eyes were tightly shut. He did not want any mental photographs to take home, should he survive. He opened his eyes and in the split second before the lights were shut off, he saw a steaming heap of cooked flesh and charred bones where his daughter used to be. He could not cry, his blood was barely flowing. In the darkness again, he now heard voices. Multiple voices, speaking in a language he could not understand. One man pointed to the center of his chest and they all seemed to agree with him something. Gregory grew nervous. His heart began to beat faster. A tall man in the group walked over to the hidden doorway and shouted something inside, then resumed his position in the group. The men then fell to silence. Moments later a woman entered the room. She held a syringe filled with some clear, bubbly liquid. She put the needle to Gregory's heart and pushed. Birds could be heard whistling their favorite tunes as Gregory opened his eyes. Wrapped in clean, warm covers, he welcomed the sound and opened his eyes to the bursting light. The sounds of nature were full & glorious, yet something seemed to be missing. He felt reborn in those first few moments when he realized he was still alive, but now a terrible emptiness filled his mind. He ran about the house checking all the rooms, but found not one living thing. His thoughts once again filled the boundless all. What's happening? he asked himself but found no reply.

When I say a month of rain, I literally mean it; it would never stop raining. It rained that whole month nonstop, and it was kind of strange since the rain came in unannounced by meteorologists. It was almost similar to that of a hurricane, with strong winds, thunder, lightning, and lengthy periods of rain. It almost came out of nowhere, it just started pouring. The sky went dim and gloomy, the clouds rolled in, the rain fell and it continued for as long as I could remember. The lights continued in the sky every night until eventually there was the loudest thunder strike. At least, I thought it was. I bet it woke the whole town up. It struck somewhere within the woods, and then things got weird. Every night, we’d hear weird noises, voices, whispers, and scratching outside. Sinkholes or burrows could be found all over patios, lawns, gardens, and the woods. The water rose up to our waists, and eventually school was called off on occasion. My friend Finny and some other kids in our clique would visit my house often to play; sometimes, they might even stay the night. I remember this one time, waking up one night and being drawn to the window. We were in our living room, and my other friend Bryce was looking outside the window I felt enticed to look out of when I awoke. He and two other kids were at the window looking outside as if intrigued. They said that someone was calling out to them and inviting them out to play inside the rain. We looked outside and saw nothing. A few minutes passed as we continued to look out the window, feeling strangely enticed to go outside. Eventually, the rain hit harder, and it also appeared that something was swimming in my flooded back yard. It never emerged from the water to show us its identity, or what it was. We just assumed it was the rain making weird patterns in the water as it hit it. The urge to go outside remained, and we began hearing whispers again. They usually ranged from “Come outside, it is safe,” or “Come play with us.” Most of what someone would say to convince a child to come out of a hiding spot. The town was mortified, and eventually a town meeting was called. Some of my friends were missing too, and all that was left of my clique was Finny and Dalton. We waited outside the courthouse with my mom as it went on. I remember asking about what they were talking about, but my mother would always avoid telling me usually by saying “Some very boring stuff grown-ups talk about dear,” or “You’re too young, you wouldn’t understand. Plus you’d probably fall asleep, it’s pretty long honey.” I remember the night before the evacuation, exactly one day before the month finished. I live next door to Dalton, and it was the night I saw them leave. The lights didn’t even go on; they sort of just went out of the house, leaving everything behind. They didn’t bother to lock the door, they didn’t bother to pack, and they didn’t bother to change clothing. They left their front door, and they walked into the woods. I was assuming they were taking a shortcut, but I still found it pretty strange. It was drizzling a bit as they left, and the rain was beginning to die down. I started hearing whispers again, only much louder. I looked out of my window and looked at the flooded streets. I saw strange patterns in the water again, and as if it was trailing a moving object under the water. I remembered that there was a crazy person stealing children at night, and decided to close my curtains so that no one could see into my room. Then the clawing and scratching began. The whispers and scratching never left, and I was surprised I even fell asleep. We did as we were told, and stood in the muddy and murky waters. We began to hear faint whispers again, and felt soothingly relaxed. The feeling was ominous, and it persisted for the duration that we spent waiting for our mothers to return. I remember tripping into the water, or so I thought, until I couldn’t seem to stand up. I panicked when I felt a force pulling me into the water, and as I heard Finny’s panicked screams. I felt a hand grab tightly onto my shoulder, and pull me to the surface."}

The next day, while shopping for groceries the bag boy, with a crackle, transformed, still clutching her biscotti. She tenderly wrenched it from his grip, glanced around halfheartedly, and didn’t pay. Then the news reports began to get very tiresome. First it was strange, isolated events. Then it was an epidemic, then a pandemic, and then it was Susan Shepherd reporting to you live from New York City and…crackle. Suddenly, she wasn’t reporting. Suddenly, she wasn’t even alive. At first, she’d gotten dozens of calls for funerals of her husband’s mother, friends, old boyfriends, but soon even the funerals died off. There were too many to throw. “Hello,” she said, wiping sleep from her eyes with one hand and holding a candle in the other. “Attic’s that way.” “I’m going to have some tea,” she said, and began walking slowly away. Roland’s mind reeled for a moment, and then he set off for the attic. In the kitchen, Anita sleepily sipped Earl Gray when Roland trudged down the stairs with a sack over his shoulder and came upon her. He stopped mid-step and looked at her carefully. “All those people up there…” “The glass ones?” Pause. Sip. “Yeah, the glass ones,” “What about them?” “Why did you-” “Think of it as a sort of a tomb.” Roland decided he’d stay. Anita mistrusted him at first but soon found it was a great relief just having him around. She was running low on food and it really was lovely to have someone to break into a grocery store with. As much as she knew how low the chances were of her finding anything dangerous, the lonely streets seemed much less so with a companion. He tended the garden, collected rain water for drinking and bathing, and even sometimes sat with her by the fireplace, sharing a seemingly endless stockpile of tea with her, “We’re going to run out of food, you know.” Roland mentioned. “Even just between the two of us, there’s only so long that that store will hold out.” Roland shrugged. “I don’t know. Leave?” Anita didn’t answer. Their lives became a long journey from food source to convenience store to market to people’s basements, sleeping when they could and traveling as they pleased. They took what they needed, carried what they could, and moved on. Roland led them, taking to this life with complete ease. As they walked, he shouted things back at her like “Lovely, isn’t it?” and she never answered. He found her silence unnerving. “I’ve been thinking, Anita,” Roland said gently, “that the world ended.” She shattered as she hit bottom."}

I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value. I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasie, or a ragoust. I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 pounds. As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs. Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come. Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children, from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture. Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first year. Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they please. Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper) the remaining eighty thousand. Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice."}

My challenge was to write a story set in a combat environment. When war broke out again with Britain over the Indian territories in 1812, he left the university to join the New York militia, where he was commissioned to the rank of Captain at just 20 years old. He was given command of a company of some sixty men, and ordered to march to Lake Ontario, where he was to establish a fort to prevent British amphibious incursions. The land Captain Saxon chose for his new fort was poorly suited to the purpose. He selected a low clearing surrounded by woods about a quarter of a mile from the lake. The ground was permanently moist and rocky, and the clearing itself was barely spacious enough to hold a small post. The mosquitoes were a terror. Captain Saxon named the post Fort Kant. His mission was to watch for British patrols, but there was never any sign of the redcoats. He turned his focus to the matter of shoring up his garrison's provisions for the coming winter, sending out foraging parties and excising supplies from local farms. They eventually planted a vegetable garden. Daniel took to meditating in the evening down by the lake. Sometimes he would see a warship, but never any land forces. Now and again he would drill the men, but that quickly became tiresome. He soon felt his assignment was pointless. The prisoner was housed in a tent within the fort and an extra section of fence was put up to sequester him from the rest of the garrison. Two militiamen guarded him at all times and he was not to speak to the other men. Sawill's only last request was a Bible. His execution was delayed a few days for a supply party to find one. The best they could manage was an old hymnal, found at a nearby farm. When it was time to muster in the spring, some men did not report back, and there were a few new faces. Despite not having a complete complement of troops, Daniel received orders to abandon Fort Kant and march east toward the new front at Lake Erie. He was to join with a company of regulars where a new fort was being built. They took what supplies they could carry and buried the rest. There was no time to demolish the fort, as his orders were to depart immediately. Having slept a few hours, they decamped just before dawn. Saxon diverted his course somewhat, but his next destination remained the same: a frontier town en route to the site of the new fort. There they would commend the wounded militiaman to the care if the townspeople, rest, and resupply. The minister merely nodded. Daniel wanted to ask if he himself believed in God, as his face left him unsure. Their conversation ended with the minister inviting Daniel to service the next day, and him declining. Some of his men did attend, and when it was finished, they formed up and began the next leg of their journey. He gazed over the lake. Not a vessel in sight, but that meant nothing. Greenwald privately intended to surrender or abandon the fort if the British won the expected upcoming naval showdown, regardless of his orders. His quartermaster ran up the hill where he was perched, informing him that somebody was approaching the fort by horse. The major could see him from there, clearly an inexperienced rider, bolting up the path like a drunk lunatic. Greenwald cursed. Not only would his reinforcements not arrive at all, but there were Indians about, and bodies to recover out there. He wanted to literally shoot the messenger. Barely able to contain himself, he sent as many men as he could afford to the scene of the massacre. They brought back as many bodies as they found, but Captain Saxon's was not among them. Late October, 1814 For Colonel Silver, these were all things he'd heard before. But for Major Bowers and the other officers, they portended a revolution. The Colonel decided to speak to Saxon himself. He arrived at the fort one Saturday, the rangers hiding about in the woods in case of an emergency. Image sourced from Wikimedia Commons"}

Almost all of my dreams were always about her. She was of unparalleled beauty. She always smiled. She didn't dawn a big smile in my dreams. But it was a smile that you could not help but smile along with. She never spoke. She only smiled and looked into my eyes. I always felt as though I recognized her but I could never figure out who she was. It was frustrating. Until the voices came."}

You might be coming down with a cold or something, best be careful. Last thing you need is to catch pneumonia and make them rumors a reality. Tell me what you want to eat and I'll get it whipped up and you fixed back into shape!” “I'll have a hamburger with coffee.” “Yeah,” came Jason Marlow's terrified reply. “You sound a lot better! I hope you enjoyed your meal. Thanks for buying the diner and keeping us afloat, boss!” The attempted dine and dasher internally smacked himself. Save for the walls, floor, and the door that hung at the opposite end, the front room was entirely bare. Despite the trepidation, Marlow carried himself across the empty room, his footsteps echoing throughout. Shakily, he reached out an arm and flung open the door to reveal a rail-less stairway. The split second his feet came to rest on the first step, his brain instinctively knew that there was no turning back. With each successive step ascended, Jason Marlow became more confident. By the time that he reached the final floor, he was a different person entirely. Christoph Laurie threw open the door to his former office. A scrawny, well-dressed, glasses-wearing man, who might match most people's imagery of an accountant, looked up from the chair in which he was seated. The seat-warmer's eye's bulged with fear from behind their frames when he registered the man that stood before him. The retired judge slowly strolled into the room, relishing the other man's fear which practically lingered through the air. “Mi-Mister Laurie,” the seated man exclaimed as he rose and slowly backed up into the large window behind him. The business owner cracked his knuckles, continuing to edge toward the room's other occupant, and replying, “I don't like to leave my work unfinished.” “That makes two of us,” exclaimed Heywood with a shrill cry as he reached into a pocket underneath his jacket and retrieved a small pistol. A tiny funeral procession was held in honor of Christoph Laurie, even smaller than the last. No one paid any attention to the body on display. A man and woman were off to the side chatting, a well-to-do married couple. Their discussion was one that everyone present was having with each other. “This is the fourth time, Joel!” “Martha, I swear this is the last of his funerals we'll go to. Regardless of if this body ends up not being his.” “At least the first one they buried looked like him! I've heard that two of the times they exhumed his grave, the bodies didn't even look similar!” “It's so peculiar. The person on display at every funeral looks exactly like him and we've seen them buried. It's almost like someone is swapping bodies as a cruel joke.”"}

My house was a typical middle-class, suburban, two-story home at the back of a cul-de-sac. My room is above the garage with a great view of our big back yard. There’s a little roof outstretching from right below that window and oftentimes in summer I would sit on the roof at night and watch the stars. About a minute, maybe less, passed and that’s when I saw them. The first came bursting through a canopy of trees at the edge of the creek. It was a figure, definitely male, running through the tall grass of my backyard, sprinting. It looked as if he was running for his life. Shortly behind was another figure, seemingly male, about the first figure's height following him, running directly behind him and quickly shortening their distance apart. As quickly as they appeared in the tall grass, they disappeared from my view just as quick. I ran downstairs to see if I could better see what was going on from my patio doors. As I got to the doors I heard a final yell, but this time the yell lasted for maybe a half a second, and sounded like it was cut short. I assumed the worst. I slowly began to back away, however, when I did that all I could make out in the darkness was it raising its arm and waving at me. It did see me. I was sure of that now. Horrified, of whatever it was or whoever it was, I ran to my room. I shut my window immediately, closed the blinds and then proceeded to turn on all the lights in my room, watch every last stupid infomercial that was on TV and call everyone in my contact list to try and calm me down. I didn't sleep until the next afternoon. As my parents awoke the next day, I told them what I saw but left out the part of the figure waving at me, as not to frighten them. The most terrifying part of the whole ordeal, however, was not seeing the body. The thing about that night that rattles me to my core, the one image that has since been burned into my brain and haunts me on that occasional night, was when I ran upstairs right after it waved to me. I shut my blinds, turned on the lights and watched TV all night. But there was one last moment, where I cracked open my blinds, just to see if dawn was approaching. As I peeked out I saw someone standing on my roof, outside my window with his eyes as close to the glass as possible, just staring at me. Watching me. I will never forget those eyes, those twisted, bloodshot, yellow eyes."}

You’ll find no monkey paws or mogwais here, Chamberlin.” “It’s Ivy’s and Envy’s problem now, is what it is, and I’m not even sure what they’re trying to do with the Sand,” Seneca said dismissively. “I do. They’re trying to fix your mess,” Mothman reminded him. “Not a problem, Mr. Crowley. I’m always happy to accommodate the specific needs of my valued patrons,” Mothman nodded. “And in your case, I’m certain I’ll have no problem telling who the speaker is.” “Frauleins! Frauleins!” Raubritter barked, rudely gesturing to a pair of young waitresses holding sterling hors d’oeuvres platters. They each politely excused themselves from the guests they were serving and moved across the room as quickly as they could without risking losing their cargo. “Yes sir? Something from the bar? Or would you care to try some seafood hors d’oeuvres?” the blonde one asked with a painfully fake smile. “There’s baked clams, crab cakes, salmon puffs, prosciutto-wrapped shrimp, lobster stuffed mushroom caps, caviar on bruschetta –” “Nein! Nein! Nein!” Raubritter cut her off with a swift chopping motion of his hand. “Due to elements of Rabbinical alchemy used in my transmogrification, I can partake of nothing Leviticus condemns as an abomination!” “The… salmon and caviar are Kosher, sir,” the dark-haired waitress said tentatively, gently holding her platter out towards him. Raubritter responded with a cold stare through his tinted, hexagonal spectacles before turning to face his host. “Meremoth, please to be explaining the Aryan and Oriental Frauleins here,” he demanded. “Why are you not using Pascal’s girls?” “Because the Darling Twins have been worse than usual lately and Pascal’s not willing to let their staff work at any venue where they might show up,” Mothman explained. “They’re not coming here tonight though, are they?” Crowley asked in alarm, wheeling back slightly and quickly checking to see where the exits were. “They’re not invited, and I’m not auctioning off anything of theirs, but if they do show up you know the protocol,” Mothman replied. “Never mind the Darlings, Crowley. Raubritter raises a good point,” Seneca interjected. “This is an exclusive event of the Ophion Occult Order, and Mothman was just going on about how carefully vetted his guests were. What about your staff, Meremoth? Where exactly did you pick up these two-bit strumpets?” “Was it the cluster of ganglia wrapped in the prehensile nerve fibers?” Raubritter asked. The dark-haired girl responded with a squeamish nod, reluctant to even speak of the incident. “I’ve run into that Unmensch before as well. Most unpleasant, and quite obviously Crowley’s handiwork.” “And why is that? Because it’s a brain monster, you automatically associate it with me?” Crowley demanded, shaking around furiously inside his vat. “I take supreme umbrage to these specious allegations against both myself and my prestigious body of work!” “What are your names, girls?” he asked. “Halcyon, sir, and this is Emma,” the blonde girl replied. “Halcyon? That’s a ludicrously pretentious name,” he scoffed. “Seriously? My name’s pretentious?” she hissed softly through clenched teeth. And Emma knew that Halcyon wasn’t one to tolerate disparagement from anyone. “Everyone calls her Halcy, sir,” she said with a nervous laugh, stepping in between them to prevent the situation from escalating. “I apologize for her disrespectful comment, but we’re just new to this and still a little confused by your Order’s… distinctive customs. She just thought that her full name might fit in a bit better around here. But Mr. Mothman was right; we’re not daughters of ancient and arcane bloodlines, so Halcyon is probably a bit pretentious for day-to-day use. We’ll take care not to step out of line like that again; I promise.” “Sorry,” she muttered, averting her defiant gaze away from Chamberlin. Seneca cast a questioning glance towards Mothman, who merely shrugged in response. “If you want me to throw her out over that then you’re going to have to explain to my guests why we’re short-staffed this evening,” he said. Groaning in resignation, Seneca swallowed his bile and let the insult slide. “So then, Halcy, that incident in the Cuniculi was your only encounter with the paranormal before meeting Mothman here, was it?” he asked. “ Mm - hmm ,” Halcyon hummed without opening her mouth. Chamberlin continued to eye Halcyon suspiciously. He was certain she was lying, but without anything concrete to support his intuition, he could do nothing without causing a scene. “Very well. Off with you then,” he said with a dismissive wave of his right hand while using the left to snatch a salmon puff off of Halcyon’s platter. The girls bowed politely, and resumed their rounds of distributing hor d’oeuvres and taking drink orders. “Why’d you have to back-talk him?” Emma whispered as soon as they were out of earshot. “It slipped; I’m sorry,” Halcyon apologized. “He’s just such an asshole. Strumpet means prostitute, right?” “You could have ruined everything,” Emma reminded her. “Just hold in there until the auction starts.” “I will. Don’t worry,” she promised. Making sure that no one was watching, she pocketed one of the crab cakes, feeding it to the crimson-eyed black rats that were nesting in her dress. “Almost showtime, little guys.” “Four hundred and twenty thousand!” “… four hundred and twenty thousand. Thank you, Professor Crowley. Can I have four hundred and forty thousand, please? Any bids for four hundred and forty thousand?” “Seems impractical, no?” Raubritter mused as quietly as he could, leaning as far away from Crowley as possible. “Only yields a few drops of blood at a time, yes? And if you hang it upside down, it does not work as art, I think. Too confusing to look at. Just blasphemy for the sake of blasphemy. Senselessly provocative. And again, with the Rabbinical alchemy in my veins, satanic powers are best avoided. I will pass on this, I think.” She noticed him staring at her, and responded with a smug and sinister smirk before she began softly mouthing words at him. “Red Ruck, run amok, crowned the Regent Red. Eyes aflame, soul untamed, come join me in my bed!” She, and likely Emma as well, were followers of the Regent Red. But the sickeningly familiar melody of a flute robbed him of all courage and froze his heart solid. The auction house immediately fell silent, everyone turning every which way to locate the source of the intrusively whimsical sound, eventually spotting Red Ruck sitting in the rafters above Seneca. Ruck ceased playing his flute, and looked down at Mothman with a wide and menacing smile. “Are you going to let him speak that way to your ‘welcomed guest’, Meremoth?” he asked. “I am not Nazi, I am Prussian!” Raubritter objected. “And I am not Kosher, I am cursed!” “You! You did this! You summoned him here!” Seneca spat. “Mothman, I saw her mutter his name! She lied! She’s one of his followers! They both are!” The scourge was real enough to draw blood, it seemed. Before he could get up, Ruck leapt down upon him from the rafter and pinned him down with his clawed foot, the weight of his netherous form making it difficult to breathe. “Alas, my issues with this coward tonight go beyond his indiscretions against my fearsome Halcy,” he announced. “He’s tried to have me murdered, for no other reason than carrying out his justly decreed punishment. He’s gone and offered me up to Emrys as a sacrifice!” “Goddammit, Samantha!” Seneca cursed under his breath. Now the size of dogs, more of the nightmare creatures formed a perimeter around the room. Circling the crowd as they flew through the air, the swarm herded the guests into the center, hissing and snapping at any who tried to escape. “How – how are you doing this?” Seneca stammered in terrified disbelief. “How are you bringing your nightmare creations into the waking world?” “You don’t need to know how, Seneca. You only need to know that I can,” Ruck smiled. Raising his clenched fist into the air, he imploded the glass of the windows inwards, revealing a forest of charred trees and crimson fog on the other side. Halcyon and Emma hopped onto two other members of the swarm as they all gave chase, with Ruck himself bringing up the rear. “Be sure you pay both of them for the full night, you hear me Mothman?” he shouted over his shoulder as he vanished out the window. “I’m sure you’ll agree that such a pittance isn’t worth losing any sleep over!” “Ruck! Ruck! I’m sorry! I’m sorry I offered you to Emrys!” he cried out. “End this, and we can work something out. I’ll get you anything you want! Anything I –” “Stop begging!” Ruck shouted into his face as he perched onto the opposite side of the crown. “Stop bargaining! Even with your life actually on the line, you’re still too pathetic to fight back!” “How am I supposed to fight off dream forms in the waking world!” Seneca demanded. “Halcyon did it!” Ruck shouted back. “A mortal girl not even one-tenth your age, with none of your skill or knowledge of the occult, fended off and then tamed the creatures that hunt you now! You have no excuse, Seneca! I weary of your cowardice. This is your last chance, you hear me? If you do not fend off the wolves this time, it’s your real body that will be torn to shreds. You fight, or you die.” “Your ceremonial serpentine sabre. You really should carry it on you rather than leaving it down in your ritual chamber,” Ruck chastised him. “These are dangerous times for the Order. You never know when you might need to defend yourself.” Seneca jumped to his feet and pulled the sword from the earth. Screaming, he swung it wildly as he charged towards Ruck, who effortlessly vanished into thin air before he was able to make contact. The seven demon-winged ravens above him broke out into a cacophony of cawing, the nearby wolves howling in return, so close now that Seneca could hear them crashing through the thicket. Terror-stricken though he was, he retained enough presence of mind to know that Ruck didn’t have the ability to cast living nightmares into the waking world unaided. The ravens above him, and the wolves closing in around him must have some type of physical body to support their dream forms. There must be some type of living creature hidden beneath the nether, and that was what he was actually fighting. More importantly, that was something he could actually fight. “No!” he heard Halcyon shout from above. The rest of the wolf pack skidded to a stop, suddenly reluctant to come any closer, while the ravens shrieked in outrage at the maiming. “Rats?” Seneca murmured incredulously, holding the struggling rat up to his face in morbid curiosity, utterly bewildered as to how it was still alive. “They’re all just rats?” “Satisfied, Ruck?” Seneca screamed to the trees around him. “You and your minions might be indestructible in a dream world of your own making, but once you set foot in the real world you are Regent of nothing, you hear me? Nothing! Your girls and your rats are subject to the same natural laws and physical limits as anyone else, and I’ll not hesitate to do to them what I’ve done to this blighter here if you ever try something like this again!” Heedless of his threat, Halcyon leapt down from her mount, her scourge raised in heated anger as she moved to strike. “No!” Ruck shouted, materializing behind her and holding her back. “It’s over! Seneca, it’s over. You’ve met my terms; you’ve won. Congratulations. Hand the rat over to Halcy, and we’ll be on our way.” “It’s all over, Ruck! You want this furball back? Then swear on the River Styx to never again haunt my dreams; to never enter my mind, abduct me to your realm, or attack me in the waking world.” “I… I swear on the River Styx, that if you return that rat to us, the Nightmare Realm and its subjects will never trouble you again,” Ruck sighed. But that could wait. For the first night in a long time, Seneca was finally going to get a good night’s sleep."}

I asked her what was wrong and she told me a seriously disturbing story. In her words, this is it: By accident, I discovered reddit and, not long after, /r/gonewild. At first, I only looked. I envied. I wished I could have that attention. I craved it. I decided that was what I wanted. I could be whoever I wanted to be. They asked me to show more skin. They called me beautiful and listed in detail things they wanted to do to my body. I couldn't wait a whole week this time. My third post was only two days later. A shot of my uncovered breasts. He said: “Someone so gorgeous deserves someone worthy of her.” It stood out because it wasn't a dirty comment. It was sweet and innocent. I thanked him. I replied with: “You wouldn't if you knew me.” His reply was strange, but I thought nothing of it. “But I do know you.” I laughed it off. “I meant in real life.” His reply was a link to a picture. I clicked it and my heart stopped. It was me at the mall, looking through lingerie. How did I not notice someone watching me? I wanted to call the cops, but I felt as though I’d brought it on myself by posting on the internet. I needed to find out how he found me. I must have left some clue in my pictures. I went though them, one by one. I couldn't find anything. Then, I saw it. In every picture, on my right hand, my class ring. He knew what college I went to because of my class ring. I wondered if he was also a student. What if he was near me all the time without me knowing? She came back. I was so grateful. She unlocked the door and let me back in, locking it again behind us. She then called the police. I contacted the police department and told them about the new message. They took note of it and said the officer would be on my block again that night to keep me safe. What about during the day though? How was I supposed to go outside? I weighed my stalker’s options. Left led to the lunch quarters and right led out to the main office and visitor parking. Assuming he wasn't a student, I went right. I ran. I reached the parking lot and saw a car leaving. I didn't know that it was my stalker, but I memorized the license plate and saved it in my phone. After that, I went to the front office and asked to speak with security personnel. I didn't answer as always, but this time, he kept going. “I love those little black panties you’re wearing.” I was wearing black panties. I was frozen with fear. “You know that sexy little yellow dress in your closet?” “It smells nice.” I bolted out of the room and grabbed my purse, whipping out the gun. I fumbled to turn off the safety. He was in my closet. I went back to my room and ripped open the closet door and fired. I managed to blow a hole in the back of my closet wall as well as make my ears ring worse than I thought possible. Since he couldn't text me, he would have to find another way to contact me. And he did. He started another Facebook account. This time it was a guy named Chance. Someone also from class. “You’re cute. I was wondering if maybe you’d like to go out for drinks sometime?” I knew it wasn't Chance. Chance was gay. But I sent back: “I would love to. What place did you have in mind?” He told me to meet him at a bar on the North side of town. It was an old bar and it didn't get a lot of business. There would probably be no one there. I told my brother and he let the police know, just so my stalker wouldn't see me communicating with the police. I drove to the bar and stood outside in my yellow dress. I was a bright splotch in the darkness. I could barely breathe. A car pulled up next to mine. It was a shitty navy blue Ford Probe. I waited, holding my breath. No one got out. At the last second, he reversed and peeled out of there pretty fast. The undercover cop parked across the street sped after him. They caught him. Do you know who tortured me all that time? Do you know who ruined my life all because of some naked pictures on the internet? A fucking kid. He was a sixteen year old dropout who spent all his time fapping to his computer screen. When he saw my class ring and realized I was so close, he became obsessed with having the real thing. I still have nightmares because this fucked up little brat couldn't get some.

A string of hazy images come to mind like random snapshots out of time, each one associated with certain feelings and emotions. They are imbued with a mystical dreamlike quality, a gift born of childhood naivety. The magic of every Christmas when Santa was still real, for example, is an experience of pure joy that is lost with maturity. I don’t think so. Sure, I have memories of distant dreams, but there is a clear distinction between the dreams and reality of my past. I don’t know how I can tell, I just can. And for this reason one memory has always troubled me. The experience was so surreal, and yet certain details stand out with marked clarity. I also remember my brother telling me about a weird dream the next morning. He’d dreamt of a woman who lived “under the floor” and came out at night to play in the rain.

I don't know why it fascinates me to see them in pain. I often wonder if they are pretending it hurts. Logically it doesn't make sense, but it's hard to imagine anything else. They just aren't as real as me. Which is an excellent segue to my next point. Dr. \"Steve,\" who, for reasons known only to himself, believes me incapable of pronouncing his real surname Streibach, has not gotten any closer to diagnosing me. He still believes I lie on the autism scale and might have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or possibly Oppositional Defiance Disorder. I enjoying playing games with him. Sometimes I'll close the door to his office an odd number of times, counting, other times I leave it slightly ajar, as if I forgot altogether to close it. It's very funny to watch him scribble notes about it. It was an exceedingly wise decision to keep two separate journals. Mother no longer asks what I'm writing, as I often leave the decoy journal open or unlocked. I've been copying the entries from a site online and changing the names and dates to fit my life. I want my parents to leave me alone and yet I crave their attention. I don't know why. I don't know if this is normal or if I want it to be normal. This portion of my daily writing relates to the entry on November the 29th. As I mentioned earlier, we have mice. This is no doubt due to my stupid younger sister, Samantha's inability to get food in her mouth. When I was 18 months old I could eat perfectly well. But I digress. We have mice, and after much cajoling, screaming, begging and tantrums, I managed to convince my parents to use \"humane\" mouse traps, i.e. traps which merely capture the mouse alive as opposed to killing it. They actually thought it was promising, assuming that I was somehow troubled by the prospect of killing the mouse. The truth, of course, is that I wanted to experiment on the mouse. As I have mentioned in several entries, I desire to be a scientist, probably in biological sciences. My idol was Louis Pastuer, though that may be changing, as I will explain below. A mouse was caught in a trap under the basement steps. I found him before Father got home and stole away with him to my room. I want to know if his pain is real, or if it's something pretend. I've designed an experiment to do this and am excited to begin first thing tomorrow. Dr. Streibach wants me to sit through another I.Q. test. He thinks I \"gamed\" the last one. He asked me about it during my session today. He said, \"Richard, why didn't you try your hardest on the test I gave you last month?\" I told him, \"I did, Dr. Steve. It was really hard.\" \"I know you're smarter than this test shows. I want to talk about the letter C today,\" he said. \"But you didn't mark all of the answers C,\" Dr. Streibach observed. I was unable to write yesterday as I was too busy with my experiment. The mouse, which I named Samantha, for obvious reasons, was an interesting subject. I was not aware until yesterday that they could vocalize. Samantha vocalized extensively, much like the real Samantha, however, I found mouse Samantha's vocalization more pleasing as I controlled it. I won't go into minute details of my experiment (I've entered them into a \"Lab Notebook\" hidden in the usual place), but suffice it to say it was extremely insightful and enjoyable. It makes me wonder how different a mouse is from a person. I briefly fantasized about Samantha the baby while experimenting on Samantha the mouse. Would she make the same noise if poked with a needle? I imagine she would to some degree. I have another meeting tomorrow with Dr. Streibach, he increased our sessions to twice a week after our discussion on Tuesday, December the 6th, regarding my chosing C answers. It's yet another annoyance I have to suffer through, though I do enjoy his interest in me. I think some day even his bumbling notes will be in a museum, as documentation of my greatness. She's like me, but still less real. I will explain how I discovered this. At her house she showed me to her room. She showed me her books of which she pretended to be very proud. I asked which was her favorite. She paused and looked at me. It was the look Dr. Streibach sometimes gives me, a calculating look. Our eyes met and she smiled. I tapped the binding of the nearest book on the shelf. \"The spines aren't cracked. They've never been opened.\" \"Would you like to see my favorite book, Richard?\" \"Sure, that'd be cool,\" I replied. She went to her bed and pushed the mattress over a small ways exposing the boxspring. There was a cut in the cover of the boxspring which could have been an incidental tear but wasn't. She fished inside and pulled out a thick book entitled \"Anatomy of the Human Body,\" the author's name was Henry Gray. I have heard of it before, Dr. Streibach has a copy on his shelf, but I never thought to look in it. It was glorious. The engravings were beautiful, the renditions of human organs superb. It was so much better than disecting Samantha the mouse. \"Do you like it Alfred?\" she asked me. I tried to hide my excitement. \"I don't know, it's kinda cool I guess.\" \"Drop the act Alfred,\" she said smiling. \"I'm not quite so blind or foolish as your parents or Ms. Stevens. You're like me. That's why you asked about Theodore Bundy. By the way, everyone calls him Ted.\" I might have kept up the act but I could see it was pointless. She stood staring at me, hands on her hips, waiting, calculating. \"I think a man of such esteem deserves the full measure of my respect.\" \"Theodore Cowell,\" we said in unison. \"We're both intelligent, Alfred. It would be mutually beneficial to combine our intellect toward a common goal.\" \"What goal would that be?\" I asked. \"Greatness,\" she replied simply, and I knew it would be good for me to work with her. \"Do you have a psychologist or other mental health professional working with you?\" she asked as we sat on her bed thumbing through the pictures. \"I do,\" I replied pausing to look at an excellent picture of a cat's still beating heart. \"Has he a diagnosis for you?\" I smiled proudly. \"I've been toying with him. He currently thinks I'm OCD, that means...\" We will meet again tomorrow or the next day. She suggested we make a secret language to avoid detection and tell the other students that she is my girlfriend so people don't ask why we spend so much time together. I liked this idea, and the prospect of spending time with her. She likes to hear my ideas for great things to do. The plan, as it currently stands, is that I will lure Mother away from Samantha during her afternoon nap. Next, Katherine will sneak in the house, go up to Samantha's room and take her out of the house. She'll keep Samantha in a hidden place (an old shed I found in the woods last summer while exploring, see entry dated July the 11th). Katherine kissed me before she left, it was very enjoyable. I've begun putting together a \"kit\" for our plan. Just some instruments I want to use in our experiments with Samantha. It is essentially an expanded version of the tools I used on Samantha the mouse. My heart races just thinking about this first great deed in what I can only imagine will be many. We expect to put the plan into motion on December the 24th, as an early Christmas present to ourselves. I want Katherine to kiss me when we're done. The best part about this Christmas is what my parents told me earlier today. Mother is pregnant. Before I met Katherine this would have seemed like a nightmare, but now that we are working together it's actually really exciting. With all the things we learned from Samantha, I can only imagine how informative it will be to experiment on a subject carrying a child!"}

I refer to this group of people as 'Empty's', for nothing exists within them at this point except for a desire to be rid of their regrets. Occasionally, one or two of these poor souls will, through instruction or sheer luck, gain access to a more 'unconventional' means of absolution. Have you heard of the String theory: a hypothesis proposing the existence of an infinite number universes, each one differentiated by a string of variables and events scattered across millennium of each universes existence? This theory is much closer to reality than what people suspect. Some souls manage to break the ancient seals of the earthly realm. Fueled by their selfish desire to rid themselves of their regret, they call upon ancient, unspeakable magics to erase their universe, its life, its achievements, and, of course, their own regrets along with it. Once this phase of the ritual is complete, the Empty is given a choice whether to continue in their pursuit of a new life or to accept their current one. If an Empty chooses to withdraw from the ritual, they will wake up at the location where they summoned the spirits of time but will be unable to remember doing so. They will live the rest of their lives with perfect memory, remembering always the best and worst times of both their past and future, a small price to pay for such a selfish whim. If an Empty chooses to continue with the ritual, then both I and the spirits are rendered powerless to stop them. Once a link has been forged between two universes, the gateway will be exposed to The Void and the timeless, ancient horrors which dwell within it. This is the most dangerous stage of the ritual. Once a successful Empty completes the crossing, the forces of the Void will stream into the old universe, consuming it and all its inhabitants and claiming the universe for the Void. The Empty, however shall be safely warped to their new universe, starting their lives afresh from birth as they seek to remodel their old lives into one with no regrets. My greatest fear, however, is for myself, for the beasts of the Void, in their hatred of humanity, must detest and revile their creator even more so. I fear that I am powerless against such blind fury. Humanity has many flaws, but their worst is their fixation on their regrets. That is my greatest sin and my greatest regret; to have doomed humanity from the beginning. I know not what fate awaits humanity. And I know not what fate awaits me; a powerless god. It is only matter of time."}

My company was one of those stationed at Fort Phil Kearney, commanded by Colonel Carrington. The country is more or less familiar with the history of that garrison, particularly with the slaughter by the Sioux of a detachment of eighty-one men and officers—not one escaping—through disobedience of orders by its commander, the brave but reckless Captain Fetterman. When that occurred, I was trying to make my way with important dispatches to Fort C. F. Smith, on the Big Horn. As the country swarmed with hostile Indians, I traveled by night and concealed myself as best I could before break. The better to do so, I went afoot, armed with a Henry rifle and carrying three days' rations in my haversack. \"They waited. For two days and nights, crouching behind a rock topped with a growth of mesquite, and with the cliff at my back, suffering agonies of thirst and absolutely hopeless of deliverance, I fought the fellows at long range, firing occasionally at the smoke of their rifles, as they did at that of mine. Of course, I did not dare to close my eyes at night, and lack of sleep was a keen torture. \"I remember the morning of the third day, which I knew was to be my last. I remember, rather indistinctly, that in my desperation and delirium I sprang out into the open and began firing my repeating rifle without seeing anybody to fire at. And I remember no more of that fight. \"'Dave Duck,' I answered; 'who should I be?' \"He stared like an owl. \"'Sure,' he answered—'just as I told you. It was Dave Duck, all right; most of us knew him. And now, you damned impostor, you'd better tell me who you are.' \"I'd give something to know,' I said. \"A week later, I escaped from the guardhouse and got out of the country as fast as I could.

After that moment the man questioned once more, \"Why are you here?\" My hands gripped into my leggings tightly, the red liquid staining them. \"I... I don't know,\" I finally responded. I looked back up at the man as the sun blinded me. His muffled smile still keeping his devious appearance intact. \"You don't know? Well then why do you stay?\" I let my vision go back to the golden yellow ground once more as I replied woefully with, \"I don't know.\" The man's dim smile was unwavering. He released a long, stressful sigh and took a seat on the other side of the empty bench. I took my sight away from his and let the undying silence sink in. \"Then I will stay and see this through to the end.\" The speaking cut there. I shut my eyes and took one more moment to let everything that just happened sink in. I opened my sleepless eyes and stared up into the cloudless sky. The emotionless affect on my face didn't detract from the fear in my eyes as I lifted the gun and shoved the barrel into my mouth. I shut my eyes and was about to pull the trigger, when I heard rattling voices about. I opened my eyes to find myself in the middle of a crowd of people all begging me not to do it.

And I don’t want— Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 7 p.m. That was my cue. They started the music a little early but what’s the big hold-up if everyone’s so excited? Oh boy, oh goodie me it’s Christmas! Everybody loves Christmas, right? Even Chuck—the ol’ Scrooge. Can’t turn us down again, can he? Who cares if he’s more doped up than a hooker at a bachelorette party? “Everybody’s waitin’ for the man with the bag—” Shut up Kay Starr. You and all the other pricks trying to get me up the—the— “C’mon, you can say it, Chuck.” “I know I can say it, Doc.” “Then, do it.” “The Kone MonoSpace 300 DX hydraulic elevator.” “No, I used the stairs.” “Well, you walk by it every day I assume?” “Well, see now that’s exposure! That’s progress, Charles. Pretty soon you’ll be able to press the button.” “I am not pressing the button.” “But suppose you did. What’d be the harm in it? You’re a rational man, Chuck.” “It’s the same brand as—well, y’know.” “But it’s hydraulic.” “It’s hydraulic and safe , Charles. I visited Golden Gardens; the place is in tip-top shape. I rode the elevator all the way up to the top floor and back. It’s even got an inspection certificate in it. It passed just a few weeks ago.” “And it would’ve operated completely normally if not for the—” Oh, great. Now they’re playing “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.” No, he fuckin’ ain’t. “But y’know the folks would love it. And who better to play Santa than Butler County’s finest?” “I am not Butler County’s finest.” “Humor me, Chuck. What’s the worst that could happen? Seriously?” Oh, lemme tell you. Again, whatever the hell that means. Take for instance this little fat kid that almost broke my femur, which I’ve since heard would’ve been one of the worst fits of pain a human can feel, even worse than childbirth. This kid was a close second even without the bone fracture. He plops down on my leg, and I try my damnedest not to holler as he turns to me. I know he can see my eyes watering up behind my phony glasses, but he doesn’t seem to care, at least not at first. “What’s your name, young man?” (For the life of me, I can’t remember what it was. I think it was Tommy… Tony… Terry… Your guess is as good as mine.) “And have you been a good boy this year?” At this point, I look over at the fatty’s mom and she nods to me feverishly as if her kid can’t use his words. “Are you the real Santa?” “Well, the real Santa’s making all of the toys up at the North Pole as we speak, young man. I’m one of his helpers, but I’ve still got a bit of his magic.” (The kid nods as if he expected as much.) “That’s what the one at Macy’s said too.” ( I’m sure that guy’s got the same script, kid , I thought.) “Well, Santa does have a lot of helpers, y’know.” “I want a Super Nintendo.” “That’s a popular one. I’ll put in a good word and see what the elves can whip up.” “The elves are gonna make it?” I chuckle. “Why, who else?” “Nintendo.” (I told you they’re perceptive.) “Well, the elves work with Nintendo.” “I thought Nintendo was in Japan.” “Yes… it is.” “Well, that ain’t the North Pole.” (With the Santa gig, you’ve gotta be quick on your feet.) “We send an elf to Japan every year to get the latest… Nintendo updates for all the toys.” (Again, the kid nods and I’m thinking I’m out of the woods.) “You said you have magic?” “Of course, I do.” “Then why do you need glasses?” ( To see your shoes ‘cause I know you can’t, you little twerp. ) “I use my magic for the good of children. Not for myself.” (Saving me from another philosophical debate, Richard (the camera guy) asks the kid to look at the lens and smile. He snaps a shot and then calls “next”.) “Merry Christmas, young man!” I should point out that all of this—the whole Santa thing, with the camera and the peppermint sticks and the big, golden chair—all occurred on the second floor, with escalators to either side and elevators just behind the display. This arrangement gave the Santas easy access to the break room, which was on the third floor just off the elevator. It was only a matter of putting up the velvet rope that carried the “Santa Will Be Right Back” sign on it and moseying on behind the set. From there, it was a straight shot up the elevator and then out and to the left. The break room was nothing fancy. In fact, this’ll tell you how bare bones the place was: when we got our first microwave (which was one of the old Sharp ones with the wind-up dials—not even buttons) we all lost our minds. This and a coffee maker? Since when was the Queen of England visiting Butler County? Roll out the French Silk creamer, why don’t ya? Simpson Holdings (aka Marcus Neilstrom) spared no expense, except when it was at the actual expense of Simpson Holdings (or Marcus Neilstrom). If a stupid microwave oven shut us up for another holiday season, it was a lot easier to drive on down to Kmart than to give us all time and a half. Whatever else Simpson Holdings or Marcus Neilstrom felt the hard-earned dollar of the Country Square Mall ought to be spent on (other than a ninety-five-dollar microwave on a blue-light special) remains a mystery to me, with one notable exception. I know damn well it wasn’t spent on the elevators. But, hey… piping hot Hot Pockets were nice, especially on days that dipped below fifty. Shifty would know. I can still see him in my mind’s eye, sitting in that corner booth of the breakroom, munching on a steaming meat pastry while Nat King Cole’s “Christmas Song” played carelessly through the speaker system. Every now and again, he’d look up at me mid-chew and then back down at his lunch. I suppose the sight of a sweaty minimum wage worker in a Santa suit probably wasn’t the most appetizing sight to see… but on occasion he’d grin and bear it, mostly to talk niceties like the weather or last night’s Penn State game. One day in particular, however, his tune was different. “Neilstrom talk to you?” I looked up from my ham sandwich and noticed that Shifty was staring at me blankly over his daily Hot Pocket. Steam rose from within. “Uh… did he? No, he didn’t.” Shifty nodded and then returned to his lunch without another word. “Why? Did he have one of his ‘talks’ with you?” Shifty nodded and gave an affirmative “mmhmm” through his closed lips as he chewed. “What about?” “How’s it goin’ out there, Mr. Neilstrom?” “Hello, Charles. I have something I need to discuss with you.” “The floor’s yours,” I said, and took another bite out of my sandwich. “Do you know anything about the Super Soakers or the Super Nintendo?” “I know they’re both super .” Marcus makes a not-so-amused face. “Very funny, Charles. Let’s be serious, now.” “Well, I know both of ‘em are sold at KB.” “Anything else?” “About the ones at KB or—?” “The ones in the Santa sack. The ones we put out on display.” “Is that what that is? A display?” “It was KB’s idea, actually. A way for our Santas to push the hottest new toys. Simpson Holdings sure liked the idea. More people that come to the mall for their toys come to the mall .” “Makes sense to me. What about ‘em?” “They’re missing.” “What? The ones from the bag?” “Given ‘em away?” “Precisely.” “Wasn’t me. I’m not one for handouts. Did you ask Amberson?” “Funny. Amberson said to ask you .” “Of course he did. No, other than a few kids beggin’ their mommas for one or the other… I never touched the stupid bag. I thought it was some kinda donation thing.” “It isn’t. And like you, Simpson Holdings isn’t in the business of ‘handouts’. I hope you would report anything you might see that’s… suspicious .” “Of course,” I nodded, and returned to my sandwich. Marcus returned my gesture and began to leave the breakroom. At the door, he turned back to me over his shoulder. “Oh, and we’re gonna need you down there in five. There’s a line building up.” Mouth full, I nodded once more, and Marcus left the room. That didn’t stop me from eating the rest of my sandwich, of course. But like I said, the worst will happen when you least expect it. And so, it did. Back then, there weren’t the scares of today. There were no mall “shooters”, no terrorists (that we knew of anyway). But that didn’t mean there weren’t— —because there was a fire . Beneath me. And I was trapped in an elevator. To say I panicked was one way you could put it. Another would be: Help! Help! Oh God! Jesus, Mary, and Joseph H. Christmas get me the hell outta here! Goddammit! I’m stuck in here! I’m in the elevator! The icing on the cake was the fact that even if someone could hear me out there—over the screaming and the crying and the Bing fuckin’ Crosby—what could they even do about it? I was halfway between floors in a metal box, sealed shut. A flush of relief washed over me when I heard the sirens. Oh, thank God, the fire department , I thought. Thank God, thank baby Jesus— I was about to thank the shepherds and the wise men too when that flush of relief went right down the drain. How long is it gonna take before they know I’m up here? What if they can’t put out the fire? What if they can put it out but send everybody home before they bother to check on—? Oh, shut up. Everything’ll be fine. They’re gonna put the stupid fire out and the elevator will return to the ground floor. That’s how they make these things, right? Yeah, but if this thing was working correctly… wouldn’t it be on the ground floor now? Hey, at least it didn’t fall. “Oh. So, there’re no cables?” “Some. But most of the lift happens because of pressurized oil in the hydraulic system.” “Well, at least nothing can snap and send this puppy flying.” “Unless the pressurized oil bursts.” “Oh. Then in that case—?” “It would… well, as you said, Charles… ‘send this puppy flying’. Straight down to One, in fact.” Shit. Why’d I have to remember that part? The chance of that happening is slim pickings, though. Actually, from what I know, elevator accidents are quite rare. Except for those people that get crushed when they’re halfway off, or fall seventy feet, or get decapitated— Rare. But not impossible. I doubt I’d be an exception, though. Isn’t that what all those people say? What people? The ones that become statistics. When I noticed that I was talking to my own reflection in the metal wall it felt like a slap in the face, a splash of cold water. It was sobering, really, before the laughter started. Get a grip, man. It’s been five minutes. Surely, the music’s on a different power supply is all. I highly doubt the ghosts of the Country Square Mall would take their precious time to play a disembodied recording of “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” just for me. My palms were sweating at the thought of that, not to mention it was starting to get hot, or at least hotter than it was before five—ten—God-knows-how-many minutes ago. Is there even air conditioning in elevators anyway? There has to be… ‘cause clearly, it ain’t working. Either that or— The thought of the fire inexplicably growing just beneath my feet, licking the bottom of the elevator with a long, fiery tongue caused me to jump a little before realizing that wasn’t such a good idea. Last thing I wanna do is send this puppy flying. I’m no expert but I’d have to imagine alongside breaking your femur or popping a kid out of your vag, falling or burning alive wouldn’t be far down the pain list, and falling and burning alive might very well be on top. Breathe, dammit. It’s just a stupid elevator. Oh, if these walls could talk, they’d be laughing too. Or screaming, I chuckled. I swear if I die in here… dressed like Santa Claus… listening to Eartha Kitt— “—forgot to mention one little thing… a ring. I don’t mean on the phone. Santa baby—” “—so hurry down the chimney tonight.” The chimney. That’s it. That’s what this is. I’m Santa Claus stuck in a big, ol’ chimney and if I don’t get my ass outta here I’m gonna be smoked like a turkey. Oh, that’s ridiculous. I don’t even smell any— To this day—because of that very smell—I no longer smoke. In fact, I can’t so much as sit near a fire or damn-well look at it. The heat against my skin covers me in gooseflesh and sends me straight back into that elevator, back to 1992. It’s as if, even though that place is long, long gone, I’m still trapped in there. Up there. Smoke only rises when something burns , I started to figure, so what’s on fire? Well, according to the heat rising through the floor—and through the cheap, red fabric clutching my back— I’d say it was about to be me . Quickly, I scrambled up onto my feet and began slamming the shiny metal door with my fists, then attempted to pry it open with every ounce of strength I could muster and repeated this process over and over again until I couldn’t anymore until I was either laughing manically to myself or screaming at the top of my lungs. For God’s sake, I’m still up here! Please! Somebody! I don’t wanna die in here! Eventually, my voice and my breath gave out and I nearly collapsed back onto the ground. For the love of God don’t pass out , I told myself. That floor’s hot as sin , and I could feel it through my boots. Hell, if I was in there even for ten more minutes they might’ve melted straight onto the soles of my feet. And that’s if my internal organs didn’t cook in the meantime. Is this how those poor bastards felt in the brazen bull? Like a—like a Hot Pocket? Yeah, that’s it. I’m no better off. Hell, I bet the microwave’s more spacious. Hell, I bet the Sharp Corporation wouldn’t fart out on me like this blasted elevator did. Hell, I— Hell. That’s it. This elevator’s going straight down to the fire and brimstone. Forget the chimney, forget the flue—the hearth—we’re going straight into the inferno, that’s where. We’re going— Down. I felt that stomach-dropping feeling again in full force. I was plummeting straight down. Is the elevator working again or am I falling? I thought. I’m falling , I thought, and then I checked the LCD. There isn’t a floor zero. -1… -2…. -3… Okay, I see what’s going on here. I’ve fallen asleep. Very funny, very cute but it’s time to wake up now. C’mon, Chuck… wake up… wake up… Is this thing getting smaller? I swear, it feels like the walls are closing in. Oh, get a grip, man! It’s just claustrophobia! Well, I’m surprised more people don’t have it here, considering how ass-to-ass all these stupid stores are! -23… -24… -25… Slapping didn’t work. I reached out, poking the sizzling metal wall a few times, and tried ringing the bell button. Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding-ding-ding! Ding-ding-ding! Jingle-all-the-way! Oh, what fu-cking luck I have now open the goddam door! Open it! -111… -112… Maybe I’ll do what Scrooge did. Maybe I’ll just wake up in my bed chamber in my nightgown, that’s it! Now, what did he say to get there? Oh, yeah: “I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year!” There, I said it! Is that what you wanted to hear, huh? Is that it? -356… -357… Bullshit. That’s some bull! There aren’t negative three-hundred-and-fifty-seven floors to this godforsaken place there’re three. Three stupid floors! And I’m still stuck between two of ‘em. Prolly lying on my back and drooling like a baby. -498… -499… Okay, fine! I did it! There! Are you happy? I took the stupid Super Soakers and the Super Nintendo, alright? I’m a horrible Santa, alright? Y’think Simpson Holdings pays me enough to give my son a good Christmas? Do ya? Well, it doesn’t! This mall gives me jack shit! At this point, the elevator started to slow down as it felt like the tears streaming down my face were evaporating off my skin either due to the heat or the sheer force of gravity. -657… -658... Oh, God. No, this isn’t real. This isn’t—this is one of those undigested bits of beef. One of those blots of mustard, isn’t it? More of gravy than grave. This elevator isn’t moving! -664… -665… Suddenly, the elevator jerked to a stop, and I fell to my knees. The floor beneath them stung like a wasp, even through the red pants. I sprang up and my eyes naturally darted over to the LCD (or at least the area where it was before). It was blank, and all about me was nothing but utter darkness. Then I saw the bright light and second-guessed myself. Until, at least, it started talking. “Charles? Good Lord, Charles!” “Charles,” Marcus said, his face still not defined yet, “put this on.” “Now, cover yourself up. Geez, what’s that smell?” “It’s uh,” the firefighter said, clearing his throat, “ urine .” “Oh, he pissed himself? Is that what that is?” I could smell it too. It was piss. Is that what this is? I thought, feeling the wetness soak into the blanket. Then, as I could feel the wool touching my bare skin, a second question poked my brain. Am I naked? Yes, I was. The wet Santa suit on the floor confirmed it. “W-what happened? Where am I?” “There was a small fire in the Chinese restaurant’s kitchen in the food court. You’re in the elevator… on level One.” “And the fire’s out?” “Yeah, no shit. How many hours does it take to turn the power on?” Marcus’s face grew long before turning to the firefighters and then back to me. “Charles, it’s been about twenty minutes. These men were incredibly efficient.” “Twenty minutes ?” I croaked. “More like twenty hours . Hell, I’m prolly tied with that guy from New York.” “Charles, I just saw you not twenty minutes ago. Remember, I needed you down on Two in five? That was at 11:55. It’s 12:14.” “That’s impossible,” I said. “I must’ve heard ‘Santa Baby’ twenty times. And that song’s at least three minutes.” “Sir, maybe it’s best we get you outta there and you can discuss this later,” the other firefighter said, and I agreed. In fact, I’ve agreed for the last thirty years. I’ve discussed it. No one’s bothered to listen. Not even Dr. Winfrey. I knew Marcus Neilstrom wouldn’t’ve from the very moment his shifty little eyes—even shiftier than Shifty’s—looked at those firefighters the way they did, and I knew the firefighters wouldn’t’ve from the way they looked back. Hell, it wasn’t even a shock to my system when Jay Leno got on The Tonight Show and riffed about me in his opening monologue a week or so after it happened. “Did ya hear about this guy? This mall Santa in Pennsylvania that got himself stuck in the elevator? I guess that’s one way to get kids into your mall. ‘Hey, kids, if you wanna see Santa this year you’re gonna have to go on down to Country Square and shout up the elevator shaft!’” Suffice it to say, Simpson Holdings didn’t like that one on public television. They also didn’t like the couple of Super Soakers and the Super Nintendo Marcus Neilstrom confiscated from my car. All that to say, I was promptly fired. “And I still imagine you harbor some resentment against them for that, don’t you, Chuck?” “Wow. You really dig deep, Doc.” “I’m just saying, Charles, it sounds like you’re still rattled by this thing all these years later.” “And I’d imagine, deep down, you still might even be holding onto some of that guilt you felt after stealing those toys.” “They got ‘em back. Didn’t press charges. Guess I can’t complain when my ‘punishment’ was gettin’ outta that dump.” “But it almost sounds like your real punishment was what happened in that elevator.” “Illusion of what now?” “And what’s that?” “That I was Santa .” “And because you were Santa you were… what? Held to some higher standard?” “I suppose. Really, I suppose it’s a lot like God.” Knock! Knock! Knock! “Mr. Freed? Mr. Freed? Charles? You in there.” Just stay quiet. Maybe they’ll think I fell asleep. That wouldn’t be anything new for them. “Mr. Freed, we’re all waiting for you upstairs… Mr. Claus .” Yeah, I bet you’re waiting for me… you’ve been waiting for me, haven’t you? “Chuck, are you trying to tell me that you’re gonna face some kinda judgment for dressing up like Santa at a mall thirty years ago?” “But that elevator’s gone, Chuck. The whole stinkin’ mall’s gone. Bulldozed . You got out. Got off.” “ That’s what scares me.” “What does?” “Which floor I got off on.” Knock! Knock! Knock! “Mr. Freed? Charles? Sir, we’re gonna open the door if you don’t—” “You open that door, and I’ll jump! You hear me? Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve fallen.” “Charles, that window is sealed shut—” “—did you—Charles, did you block the door? Nurse, call Dr. Winfrey.” “And what’d he tell you, Mr. Freed?” “Charles, Golden Gardens is a wonderful place. I’ve referred them many times to many clients.” “Doesn’t matter where you send me, Doc. It’s all on the same floor. All in the same place.” “And where’s that, Chuck? Back in the mall?” “No. In Hell .”"}

Oh how I wish the lonesome bird would find a partner, I truly do. It would be much better for all of us if it did. From my own position, sitting on a damp bench surrounded by finality, my mind is in disarray. The cold winter's day is enough for my own breath to appear in front of me, my thick woolen coat offering less than desirable protection from the biting weather. I take a glance at my coal black rucksack, making haste to push the protruding coil of hemp back inside of its depths. A magpie without a partner would simply not do at all. I have a partner myself. My counterpart, other half, ego balancer, he keeps me in check. Though some ways in which that manifests are debatable in their benefit to me. Alas, we coexist, him and I, and what a pair we make. And now what? We are not the same, doesn't he understand? He is nothing like me, my antithesis, and yet he exists just as much as I do, as tangible as I am. He simply does not, no, cannot fathom the process. The understanding that sin has crept into my veins is a hard pill to swallow, but it is one in which I must ingest. Hedonistic, transgression heavy and blight ridden, that is my existence. And who do I have to blame? Not the ones who weep for their lost sons, nor the ones who weep for what my mouth has uttered. I am the sole pair of shoulders, akin to Atlas and the world. My tongue is a barbed, poisonous thing, and I ought to have it removed. Oh, but my hands, my hands are brutish. Weapons of war, harbingers of grief, and where words scald the hands incinerate. Intense, vibrant hemorrhages wherever they struck, and he disapproved. He hated the colour, hated how I'd treat them like filth. If only he'd spoken up sooner, if only he'd been stronger. My soul wouldn't be quite so tainted with the stain of death. I will be victorious, old friend. He managed to hinder me, decided to throw his spanner in the works, but he will no longer hinder me now. I am in control, the master of the mind, not the servant. Despite all my woes about him, he is a comfort, a reassurance that someone still cares, still has my interests at heart, even if misguided and woefully ill educated in what must be done now. And so, as I stand, taking a last gaze at the grave I have helped to build across from me, I feel content, finally. His stubbornness notwithstanding, I enjoy his company, and I shall truly miss him, a diamond in the rough. He's there, he's always there. But god has left me, and I will accept my fate this time, whether he approves or not."}

The theater did not interest him, yet he attended often, hoping for the outbreak of a fire. He went to the fair at Neuilly to see if perhaps one of the menagerie animals might go wild and mangle its trainer. Once he even visited the bullring, but its calculated bloodshed was mundane, too controlled. Meaningless suffering revolted him; he craved the thrill of sudden catastrophe. But then one morning he saw a garish poster, one of many that covered the walls of Paris. Against a blue background, a peculiar slanted track descended, curled itself into a circular loop and then plummeted straight down. The top of the billboard depicted a tiny cyclist about to dare the dangerous route. The newspapers ran a story explaining that the cyclist intended to ride down just such a track. “When I reach the loop,” he told reporters, “you’ll actually see me round it upside down!” The press was invited to inspect the track and the bicycle. “I use no mechanical trickery,” the daredevil bragged, “nothing but precise scientific calculation. That—and my ability to keep up my nerve.” The cyclist was scheduled to perform for three months in Paris and then tour the provinces. “I know you. You come to my show every night.” “That’s true. Your remarkable feat fascinates me. But who told you I’m always here?” “No one,” the rider smiled. “I see you myself.” “But how can you, so high up? At such a moment, are you actually able to study the audience?” The cyclist laughed. “Hardly. It’d be dangerous for me to look at a crowd shifting around and.prattling. But confidentially, there’s a little trick involved in what I do.” “No, no, I don’t mean a hoax. But there’s something I do which the public is unaware of.” The cyclist winked. “This’ll be our little secret, yes? When I mount my bicycle and grasp the handlebars, I never worry about my own strength and coordination, but the total concentration the ride demands concerns me. It’s almost impossible for me to empty my mind of all but one idea. My greatest danger is that my eyes may stray. But here’s my trick—I find one spot in the auditorium and focus all my attention on it. The first time I rode in this hall, I spied you in your box and chose you as my spot. The next evening, there you were again...” Credited to Maurice Level"}

The voices did want the best for the lunatic and now it was clear. As detective Murray walked onto the scene he was horrified by what he saw. Like a pillar of rot the statue towered over him. \"There must be at least six people carved in there,\" he muttered, barely disguising his belching. The sheriff, Howard, stumbled back and screamed, \"It's moving!\" What they saw next, no one of them could believe. A dark, deformed figure started emerging from the putrid pile of rancid flesh. The eyes rotten, the fingers bent in awkward, grotesque directions and a piercing, never blinking, twisted smile. The angelic voice booming from the pillar of decomposing twisted bodies now spoke. The officers, not understanding what could be real anymore, just listened to the things it said. The lunatic stumbled towards them, slowly raising the dagger. He could now finally see the face of God, so perfect, so blinding. The horns scratched through the surface of the light as the red, blistered skin slowly seeped out a white fluid. The grotesque figure stared back down at him with black puss draining from its webbed eyes. As detective Murray's eyes shifted up, he knew he was looking at the face of God. A creature of such magnificience, he could feel it taking him to its beautiful realm. \"Antichristus regnum accipe me i vident infernalia.

I hope you enjoy it and have a good time. Lastly, merry Christmas to all of you. I hope you have a great time. The three of us sat around a fire table, pumpernickel bites neatly laid out over it; the fire crackled gingerly in the marble fireplace. We poured brandy into our tea and drank as we reclined in our armchairs. We were good friends, we were our only friends. We did not talk, we just watched the snow flakes waltz outside the window. We all smiled in the glory of the moment except Evan, who looked troubled. \"True, but memories of Christmas are not the fondest I have.\" \"No, but I will let an apple infested with worms and spiders spoil the bunch.\" \"It's a story hardly fit for Christmas,\" Evan said. \"Come on, we all love a good story, even if a miserable one. Of course, if it's too perso-\" John replied. \"Okay, I'll fucking tell it. You must know that my father left before I could remember his face and that my mother was a drunk bitch. On Christmas morning, I went downstairs to check my presents. My mother sat staring at the Christmas tree; she looked shell-shocked. She turned on me and said: \"She whipped me for about fifteen minutes and soaked my bleeding back with vinegar. Next Christmas, the same thing happened, and the next Christmas and the five Christmas' after. I lied, I didn't get this scar when my razor slipped. I got it when the whip slipped and hit my neck. \"When I snuck into the living room, I heard a rustling coming from the chimney. It sounded like a rat trying to escape a paper box. I saw a bony hand emerge from the fireplace. Then a ghoulish creature snuck out, it was as thin as a holocaust victim and lines of flesh were torn off its back. It was lugging a sack. When it saw me the monster screeched and fled. Its face haunts me to this day; a triangular expression of malice and disgust. Like an angry man chewing ten aspirins. \"I screamed something about a monster in the living room. I heard a door crash open and footsteps thudding down the stairs. My mother burst through the door. \"You know the real fucked up thing? I still cling to that immaculate behavior unless I have an argument against it stronger than fucking Fort-Knox. I'm trying to change my mindset. Micheal, you asked me once why I swear so much. Baby steps, son.\" I could relate to Evan's suffering. I also got fucked by a figure of trust and protection. After I risked my ass for Uncle Sam he slapped a medal on my chest, patted me on the back, and kicked my ass onto the icy streets. He left me frozen and broken. Evan's mother passed away from lung cancer five months later and left her son the estate. After that, we didn't see Evan until the next Christmas. \"You know,\" Evan began, \"the new h-house I've inherited, yeah? Well, I have, um, trouble you know... Sleeping there at night. Things scratch at the window. Shapes in the corners of my eyes. Umm...\" He froze, looking sick. \"Could you stay over for Christmas, John,\" Evan said. \"Can I come too?\" I asked. \"Oh... Yeah, Micheal. Shit. I meant both of you. Sorry.\" The second he finished the sentence he became pallid and frightened. \"Sure, any time. John will come too, no?\" I said. \"Yes, not a problem. I need some company myself.\" \"No please. I implore you, no! It was a joke; you cannot be troubled with my delusions. Thank you both, but I'll get over it. You'll only delay my coping.\" But it was no use: we would help our friend for he was exactly that. We set out after we finished dinner. \"Sorry about the s-state of the place. I'm having it, um, renovated soon,\" Evan said, \"I'll take John with me to c-c-chop firewood -- if he doesn't mind.\" \"Evan?\" I choked. \"Evan! What the hell are you talking about? What did it want? What is it?\" \"It was the thing that brought the coal. It said it was with the family, since forever, and that it makes sure we are good and righteous, or something. It basically makes people punish and hurt others for their sins, that is all. I don't why, it just likes to see people get hurt, I guess. Anyway, I'm sure your shocked, so let's go and chop some actual firewood. Then we'll need a drink.\" I raised my gun. \"Now, now,\" Evan snapped, \"you're shocked, I'm sure, but there's a limit, so put that down or I'll chastise your fucking ass.\" My hand faltered and I pulled the trigger. Evan ducked and threw the axe up in retaliation. A branch was blown off a nearby tree with a bang. Evan cried and charged at me. I jumped away, but the axe clipped my shin, causing me to involuntarily make a snow angel. I mustered my resolve and rose to a crouching position. The axe gleamed red in the lamp light. I saw my horrified face as the axe swung down; the reflection was swallowed by a blast of light and a new layer of blood splashed it when I blew my friend's brains out. I laid there for what seemed like hours upon hours upon even more hours until my senses surfaced. \"Alas, the last of the Writh family dies. The world shall be an oyster of sin and misdeed,\" a sepulchral voice murmured. A man of science would say the voice was a hallucination caused by shock and a frightfully real but fantastical stories told to me by a person of trust who destroyed that trust thus creating a complex in my mind. I struggled up and ran into the manor. When I ran inside, that sepulchral voice said, \"Run, run, kiddy. You may run and hide but not before I'll skin your penis with my potato peeler. If you stop like a good child, I won't suck on it afterward, yumy-yum!\""}

When night fell and we turned the light off, it was pretty much pitch black, due to there not being many windows. Because of this, my brother and I used to play hide and seek in the dark. The stairs were the safe zone, but the rest of the room was fair game. I remember one night, I hid up in the top shelf of the closet. I wasn’t exactly very big at that point, so it supported my weight. I remember an acute feeling of being watched that night, though I couldn’t place the source. Eventually, I got so creeped out that I let my brother find me. We turned the lights on. It felt safer that way. I was still mildly creeped out, but I wasn’t tired enough to go to sleep yet, and I wouldn’t have anything to do if I said no. “Alright,” I answered, trying to put on an enthusiastic front. “My turn to count!” I turned the lights back off and returned to the stairs to begin counting, while my brother retreated back into the darkness of the room to hide. I went up to it and looked through it curiously. Though there wasn’t anything out of the ordinary on the other side, I caught a hint of light blue flannel fabric out of the corner of my eye. It could’ve been a trick of the light, and my brother didn’t seem to see anything, so I said nothing. I never told Lila about the strange stuff happening around the house where me and my brother lived, mainly because I didn’t want her to think I was crazy. And she never mentioned anything of the sort either, so it was never discussed. But sometimes I’d turn towards my house and — always in my peripheral vision — catch a glimpse of light blue flannel peeking through the window. I tried to ignore it, to pretend it wasn’t there. I failed. After we finished with that, I went back down to my room. I can remember acutely a temperature drop — not by much, perhaps a few degrees — when I entered the room. I shivered, but entered regardless. “Actually, there was something,” Lila answered. “After you left, I saw this girl with red hair in the window of the stairwell, in a blue flannel dress. She just looked at me for a long moment, then calmly walked back across the field and into the trees. Never saw her again. Why’d you ask?” “N-no reason,” I answered. “Just curious.” But, walking home that day, I could’ve sworn I caught a glimpse of blue flannel out of the corner of my eye. And that night, sleeping in my bed, I couldn’t shake the image of a woman’s face, with copper hair and forest green eyes, staring back at me through the darkness."}

If the story seems incomplete, don't waste sleep over it, because hopefully a character-background pasta about Caldwell will be here soon. IT SAYS HERE that he’s an insomniac - I’m not sure. These files say he kept whining he couldn’t sleep in the asylum, before escaping and killing all those guards-“ “How do you think he did that, Laura?” “I’m not sure.” “This is so much work, Douglas. He’s literally left no clues of where he is, and there are no witnesses to survive the tale. I do wonder how he killed all those guards. Not all were drunk, you know. And he didn’t have weapons, but they did-“ “He used to be a police officer before becoming part of the Army. Then it says he became a martial arts trainer until one day he beat one of his trainees to death. He does have combat experience, Laura.” “Let’s see. His last murder was at this place and maybe we can ask Boss for some help.” She tucked the map into her pocket and started walking to a parked BMW nearby. “Do you need a ride home, Douglas?” -Hey Laura, Douglas just called me for some help on this Robert Caldwell murder case. You know I can’t do that, I have other matters to do. -I’m not sure what you guys need anyway, you’re a good pair, and what really do you need? Weapons? Vehicles? More buddies? -Well damn, you’re good at your job. If you desperately need help, give me a call. I’m sending some other detectives to check out the latest scene. She checked her others: -Use GEICO for your car insurance! Save 15%! She placed the files carefully on her coffee table before going over to the phone. Dialing a number, she waited. A hoarse, raspy voice replied: “What do you want?” She put down the phone, relieved to hear the voice. “Are you free this evening?” Douglas asked, tucking his own copy of the file into his briefcase. Avoiding his gaze, Laura straightened herself and replied, “Kind of.” Douglas beamed at her. “You think we can meet at Macaroni Grill? I have some things to discuss to you personally.” He cruised up to the restaurant, located in a grove of trees off the highway, and parked cleanly. He was early, with about fifteen minutes to go. He waited next to his vehicle, hoping that Laura remembered the deal. And she did. At 8:26, her BMW slid up next to his automobile. She was only wearing simple formal clothes, but she looked breathtaking, with her auburn hair swept onto her shoulder. Douglas was speechless for a moment. “Douglas!” She rushed over to him, smiling. “We do have some issues to discuss…c’mon, let’s go in.” With a flutter in his stomach Douglas followed her into the restaurant. Inside, it was cozily lit, with the lovely aroma of sauce and meat drifting through the air. A singing waitress was walking around with plates, her high voice straining beautiful notes. This was one of Douglas’s favorite places, and he knew Laura also enjoyed it. After ordering their pastas, they fell into rapid discussion in low voices about the nature of Robert Caldwell. Douglas’s mouth automatically said the right words, but deep inside he didn’t give a damn about Caldwell. He was thinking about Laura: her intelligence, her prettiness, her words so full of clarity and confidence…” “Um, Douglas? So you agree that catching Caldwell is our top priority now?” “Yeah, I guess.” Douglas paid the check and tipped two dollars. It was cold outside, but the night was frosty and full of stars. He slowly walked to his car with Laura, savoring every moment. “Hey Laura?” “Will you-“ His voice caught in his throat. “Will you marry me?” “Douglas, why didn’t you ask this earlier? I was waiting for it! Of course. You can keep the ring.” Douglas felt this was the happiest night in his life. He drove home, whistling cheery songs from his childhood, where he and Laura used to sing them together. Laura saw her fiancée now driving away to the interstate. She smiled slightly, but apprehension gnawed at her inside. What if…no, she couldn’t…blood…no…stop. “We found him,” Fawcett announced proudly. “But Amos,” Laura protested, her face alight with anxiety, “what if he slaughters a lot of policemen? Perhaps you should call on some official-“ “Nonsense, Laura! He may have killed a half a dozen guards at the asylum, but we’re having more. Each and every one of them is trained combatants. No worries, Miss Harding. We’ll catch him faster than you could fire a gun.” Laura’s face split into a wide grin. “We should have a party to celebrate. In fact, we’ll do it at my house. One night to get high up, and then we’ll face that bastard.” Fawcett’s grin was threatening to burst. “Brilliant, Harding. We’ll send over a good team to relax a bit. Why don’t you go home now, and set it up?” He smiled kindly at his best detective. Laura went home, relieved. Laura was making tea for the upcoming party when her phone rang. “He found me...” “Oh my god…can you defend yourself?” “I think I-“ The doorbell rang. Opening the door, Laura smiled as she saw eleven people crowded at the doorway, including Fawcett and Douglas. “I thought there were twelve of you.” “Eh, one of them got sick, I guess.” Douglas beamed at her, and Laura felt a melting sensation inside her stomach. “C’mon, everyone, let’s all have tea. We have to discuss our plans too.” She set eleven cups around the table, making sure to hand the right one to each. She took her own and sipped, relishing the burning tea, preserving her sanity and soul. “Where is he cooped up at?” “Near the bayou that runs across the forest. Source of water, I guess.” “Everyone knows where this motherfucker’s hiding out?” A chorus of frequent nods. “Scatter around in a circular position. Hide behind trees. The little grove he’s living in is tiny, so it shouldn’t be hard since he doesn’t know we’re here. So, let’s get moving – WHAT THE FUCK!” A shriveled bleeding, lung. Fawcett wasn’t stupid. He knew who the lung belonged to. Laura slowly edged behind the trunk. Something wet was smeared against her tree. Using the lighter, she found that it was…blood. Blood with a bit of intestine squished against it. The shack’s door opened. The bangs of the gun flared up the area, dazzling Laura temporarily. Dimly she saw a figure stumble back into the shack, holding his stomach – Caldwell must have been shot. All around her, other enforcers were coughing, releasing a death rattle before collapsing, staying down forever. Fawcett was last. He gasped, clawing at the ground, and his body slumped to the ground. The pang of guilt throbbing hard in her chest, Laura started running to the shack. She was almost there when she heard a voice yell out, “LAURA! What’s going on?” Laura turned toward Douglas, and at that moment, she wished he was down like the others. Laura slipped her hand into her pocket, closing around a small penknife. “Douglas,” Laura whispered, taking a step closer to him. “Douglas, you know I love you.” Douglas’s eyes widened in confusion. Laura carefully pressed her mouth to Douglas’s cold lips, and enjoyed the trickle of warmth seeping into her mouth. She held the corpse in her arms and wept, large tears gushing out of her eyes. Her howls of misery were quietly repressed by her own hand. “Thanks, sis,” his raspy voice issued. “Here,” he grunted, handing one of the bags to her. She tossed it over her shoulder. But these weren’t what was troubling Laura at the moment, as she set off toward the mountains in a distance, Robert hobbling after her, coughing hard. What troubled her was the expression of shock on Douglas’s face as his life quickly bled out of him, and the guilt bubbling and frothing inside her. With a hateful glance at her brother, she kept walking forward."}

I’ll move if you want?” She turned to look at me. She was beautiful. Bright blue eyes. Long brown hair. A warm aura. A gentle glow. The perfect woman. I was stunned by beauty. No words escaped from my mouth as I sat dumbfounded by this angel sitting across from me. She turned away and began coughing. It was a very harsh cough. The sound was one that should not come from such a fragile woman. A concerned look then formed on her face. “Are you alright?” I said. “I’ve been sick for days now. I don’t know what is wrong. I just get into coughing fits.” “Maybe you have a cold is all? I’m sure you’ll be alright, beautiful.” “I don’t think that’s the case. I feel like death is coming. I don’t think I have long.” She was gone."}

We at The Archives are ecstatic to see that your candidacy was not hindered by your recent publications in The Metaphysical Lancet. We hope that this signifies the start of a new era in mainstream science where men of original thought can have their merit recognised. You are duly qualified and a man of great intelligence; we hope that your time in Geneva presents you with many opportunities to peer behind the veil of reality and reveal the innermost secret workings of reality. Needless to say, everyone here at The Archives have always maintained the utmost faith in you and your works. On this note we would like to introduce you to A’lswa’all M’thengen. This sort of marvellous learning is one of his greatest boons. With infinite time he is afforded infinite power. It is worth reiterating that if he needs three thousand years to learn how to travel faster than light-speed then he simply rewinds the same day over and over until he has achieved it; to anyone else involved it would appear simply as though his genius is unlimited and that he is capable of building a faster-than-light-speed engine on the first try. Time simply has no meaning for him. On a similar note, we are forced to ask the same question about our soon-to-be mutual acquaintance. He gave birth to himself but when you look at him and notice his Indo-European features and his tussled brown hair you might wish to consider the following; who or what wrote this book? From where did the information—the genetic template for this man—come from? Why brown hair, and not blonde? Why is he of Asian descent and not Caucasian or African? The answer to this is that no one knows; not even A’lswa’all himself who has declined to speculate on his origins stating that such linear interpretations of time bore him. To A’lswa’all he has always existed but to the rest of us who see time as a straight line we are forced to question his origin and are provided with one of the few examples of an enigma that no one in The Archives has even the slightest idea about. The best answer any of us have is that it was the universe itself that wrote this particular book and that his origin lies in the great void of nothingness from which some other contacts of ours have arisen. We imagine you have a great deal to learn from him. Best regards, Albert Tyllingham Good Lord I didn’t see that coming. Sutter was always a man of sound mind and while it can be quite disconcerting to encounter A’lswa’all and the existential threat he poses to our cosmic significance I did not anticipate Sutter responding to it so poorly. Needless to say, we should send our condolences to his family and we should all endeavour to keep the nature of Sutter’s suicide obscured from the public. From what I have heard it was quite violent. < Previous | Next > < Previous | Next >"}

A perfect depiction of hell, if you ask me. Suddenly a creature appeared in front of the window I am looking at. The creature looked like a floating half-skeleton wearing a hooded robe. I backed down a little. The creature came closer towards me. I began to feel nauseous, and the creature mumbled something, like a mantra. I began to vomit a lot, then my vision grew weak, and I passed out. I woke up to a long, dark hallway. It hallway lacked any sort of lighting, and there are doors. A lot of them. The doors are not the usual doors you would find at an office, a school, or a hospital. You would find these doors inside an asylum. An abandoned one. The rusted door handles and the small looking glass above them creeped me out. I heard a faint scream, and a loud sobbing from the doors. I slowly walked through the hallway, not daring enough to peek through the windows of each door. Who knows what's going on inside them. My movement came to a halt when the hallway ended. There is a red door with a black handle on the end of the hallway. My curiosity bested my sane mind. When I was about to grab the door handle, I heard a screeching. A high-pitched screeching like those you would hear in a cheap horror flick. I turned around to face whatever is following me, and I froze. That floating, half a skeleton appeared in the distance, this time carrying a bloodied, rusty axe. I tried to stay calm, and turned around to open the red door. But the door won't budge. I saw the creature closing in on the corner of my eyes. I kept trying to open the door, but it didn't even move an inch. I backed down from the door, and with all my might I charged into the fucking door. The door shattered into splinters of metal and wood. Inside, I saw an enormous white void, and I jumped for the sake of the safety of my soul. \"You are not guilty nor worthy enough to be punished in a way these sinners are punished. I have granted you my forgiveness, and I shall banish you back to your realm, on Earth. But I must warn you, that we will meet again, in another time. Flee, you sinful creature!\" As soon as the voice finished talking, a portal opened up above the podium I am standing at. The portal sucked me in, to a dark and empty space, void of any signs of life. Then, I woke up. Credited to Varian F.D"}

After about twenty minutes, I thought it was the right time. I said, \"We all need that person who can be true to you.\" I continued, \"We've known each other for a long time, been through thick and thin, and I don't want this ever to end.\" I got down on one knee, withdrew the ring box from my pocket and said, \"Will you marry me?\" She looked surprised at first, and then a smile cracked across her face. I was so excited, this was it, my life was complete! She began to open her mouth. I was on the verge of tears with anticipation, but what began coming out of her mouth was not the long-awaited \"yes,\" nor was it a \"no.\" It was a laugh. Not a happy moment laugh, more like a someone just told you a good joke laugh. After she was done, she looked down at me and said, \"Oh-oh man, that was a good one.\" She then sniffled and said, \"So, how much did you pay for this wine. It's really good!\" I reached my hand into her mangled torso, grabbed her heart and ripped it out right before her eyes. Looking down at her, I could see that she was still alive, her mouth was moving as if she was trying to say something, and her eyes were fixed on me. I noticed a tear run down the side of her face. \"Baby, don't cry,\" I said kindly, \"Everybody's gotta die sometime.\" Before long, consciousness passed from her face. I placed her heart on a dinner plate, and put it in the fridge. I looked down at her body and thought, Now we can be together forever. I lifted her up and walked her into my bedroom where we ended the night like a good couple should. This time without her complaining about pain, and how her body doesn't bend that way. She was just perfect. I fell asleep with her in my arms. I spent the rest of the day making her into my own personal piece of heaven. Everyday from then on we would dance, make love, watch TV, and cuddle. It was perfect. When she began to show signs of decomposition, I would do my best to keep her looking as beautiful as she deserved. I would leave her waiting for me in my bed. Just waiting for me to come home. I would have a rush of happiness whenever I would see her lovely face as I walked through the door. I picked up a heated blanket to wrap around her abdomen and thighs to keep her \"parts\" warm. \"Who are you?!\" I shouted, it turned around smiling. It... it was her. She was holding her heart, giggling at me. \"No, no, that's impossible!\" I yelled as I began backing up and running towards the front door. The door was locked. I twisted and pulled at the lock but it was no use. It was as if some supernatural force was holding it in place. I turned around to find another way out, and she was standing right in front of me, brandishing her heart in her right hand, grinning and laughing in the most horrifying way you can imagine. She tore open one of her stitches and placed in inside. My vision began to tunnel greater and greater. This is it, I thought as I looked at the shrinking image that was my life. \"I've been waiting for you,\" she said as she extended her hand as if she was going to help me up. I kicked and flailed in a effort to retreat, I got myself up and began running but quickly stopped on the edge of a cliff, at the bottom of which there was nothing but magma and what looked like people screaming. I turned around to see her standing right there. She's going to push me isn't she, I thought, I've wronged her and now she's the one to push me into Hell. I got down and my knees and begged for my soul, \"Please, please, I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you, I just wanted to be together forever.\" She lifted me up by my neck, held me to her face and said, \"What about what I wanted?\" in a almost monstrous voice before shoving me over the cliff, catching me by my shirt. I could feel the heat of Hell on my back. I should have known the price of evil, it hurt to know that I belonged there. Shame pulsed through my heart from the things I've done to her, \"Please! I'm sorry! I'll do whatever you want me to do.\" She yanked me back and said, \"Well then, I'll grant you a chance.\" \"St. James Cathedral\" She started to walk towards the front door, motioning me to follow. I stood there as she kicked the massive door off its hinges, there was a wedding going on. She rushed in with a inhuman speed, running the knife through people like a hot saw through butter. I watched the masses of people fall, the smell of the blood sent me into a frenzy and before I knew it was rushing in, effortlessly ripping and tearing through flesh. I kept my mouth open, hoping some blood and would land in my mouth. I hacked off a man's arm and began ripping chunks of flesh off with my teeth. He was shaking as he spoke, \"D-do you take this man to death for the rest of your unnatural life?\" \"Yes, I do,\" she said gleefully. The priest went on, \"Do you take this woman to death for the rest of your unnatural life?\" \"I do,\" I said through bloodied teeth. \"Then I now pronounce you man and wife,\" he said as he dropped his Bible and ran for the exit. I looked her into her black enchanting eyes. \"Until the end,\" I said as we shared our first kiss as husband and wife. We walked out of the church, holding hands and lived happily ever after."}

The singing came to an abrupt stop as the clock chimed the hour he’d been so anxiously waiting for. His nerves tingled with excitement. He knew it was about to happen. His heart skipped a beat. As soon as he saw movement outside, Joseph leapt to his feet. What he saw was like Snow White standing outside: snow falling all around a dark-haired girl with red lips, and a long flowing white dress. He stared into her sky-blue eyes, watching her hair drift with the breeze. A sudden gust sent ripples through her dress; her slender body almost visible under the thin fabric. Walking over to the patio doors, Joseph looked up at her. He ran his index finger over the glass, tracing the contours of her outline. He started to get an erection as he noticed her chilled nipples jutting out. This was a relatively new sensation to him, and he liked it very much. “Oh, Lisa! You look beautiful!” He looked at her with love in his eyes, or at least a strong feeling of emotion. “You even found the dress I saw you wearing! Amazing!” Puckering his lips, Joseph stood on tip-toes and kissed the glass as high as he could reach. Lisa’s gaze never moved; remaining hypnotic. He gestured for Lisa to come in. Lisa stopped a few inches in front of him and knelt down. Joseph caressed her cheek with his right hand and smiled happily; leaping up and in excitement. Joseph quickly gave her a peck on the lips. A few seconds on the clock passed. He gave her a grin. Feeling shy, he dared himself to kiss her on the neck. He leaned closer and placed the kiss gently just above her collar bone, but stepping back fast to check if Lisa was still in a gaze. Squeezing his eyes closed for a couple of seconds, he opened them again to see Lisa’s eyelids flutter as if waking up from sleep. “I asked you to come over, Lisa.” “You . . . You, what?” Joseph kissed his lips again, making Lisa feel even more confused and uncomfortable. He went to kiss her once more, but she leaned back and stopped him from coming any closer by keeping him at arm’s length. “Don’t do that!” she snapped. “Why not?” Joseph asked, lip starting to quiver. “Well, because I don’t know you. And you really shouldn’t do that unless you ask first.” Joseph sniffled and was not smiling anymore. “Are you here by yourself? Where are your parents?” “They’re in the kitchen.” She felt a wave of relief. “Did someone get hurt?” Lisa asked, pointing to the blood. “No, that was Gemma.” Joseph nodded, taking her hand. “What’s your name?” “Hi, Joseph. I’m . . . “ “How did you know that?” “It was your name in my dream,” he answered nonchalantly. “Oh . . . “ Lisa desperately wanted to leave now. “H-H-How old are you, Joseph?” She couldn’t wait to let go of his hand and give him to his mother. “I’m eight!” Joseph stated gleefully. “Oh my God!” Lisa started to whimper. Lisa looked down at Joseph in horror. “And that one on top is Gemma. She came to play last night.” Joseph looked up at Lisa, grinning and laughing like a child does when they enjoy themselves. Lisa’s face flooded with fear as she gasped for breath with her hand still over her mouth. She tried to scream when she saw Joseph’s eyes begin to glow yellow, but nothing happened. Trying to run, Lisa fell backwards slamming into the floor. Joseph’s grip was getting tighter, almost crushing her hand. “No one will play with me!!!” Joseph screamed in tantrum. Leaping on top of Lisa, she tried to fight him off. Panicking and sobbing, tears ran down her face. “No, please, no!” Lisa begged. Joseph opened his mouth wide and sank as many teeth as he could into her neck, her arms giving in under his sheer strength. He felt the warm blood pump into his mouth, drinking until he heard her last gasp."}

My boyfriend and I entered my aunt's bedroom. She looked incredibly weak lying there. My aunt and I never saw eye to eye on many things. She was very devoutly Protestant, not Catholic like my mother. Meanwhile, I was a Neo-Pagan who worshiped an eclectic variety of ancient gods and goddesses. We were an odd family, to say the least. My boyfriend, lacking social graces, cut in and asked if she'd heard of the recent sasquatch sightings reported from the nearby forest. I elbowed him as if to say \"Not now.\" To my surprise, my aunt appeared interested and replied. My mother, apparently listening in, appeared in the doorway. I thought about it for a moment. It sounded to me a lot like the will-o-wisp in old Celtic lore. \"Are you sure it wasn't some kind of faerie activity?\" I asked. My mother and aunt looked at me disapprovingly. \"There are no such things. Those are all demons in disguise and they'd never do anything good. This was surely the holy spirit or some kind of miracle from The Lord. There is only one god, anything else is deception,\" my mother lectured. \"How do you tell the difference?\" I retorted. \"You just do! You use your discernment,\" she replied. My mother and aunt didn't seem very impressed by that. Late at night, when everyone was asleep, I snuck out with a small jar of blueberries and a bottle of wine in hand. I journeyed out into the heart of the forest where I found a nice spot to make an offering. While pouring out the berries and wine onto the ground beneath a tall old tree, I asked for any spirit dwelling in this forest to help me or guide me to the truth that I couldn’t see. I sat in silence and asked my questions internally. I felt an odd almost electrical feeling around me and I could pick up the smell of ozone throughout the forest as if after a lightning storm. Why does mankind struggle with the spiritual realm? I thought. How can there be so many interpretations for something as simple as a light in the darkness? I know that faith gives people a sense of comfort, but what’s really behind it all? I questioned. I just needed to know. Suddenly, I felt a strange humming in my brain. Through the scraggly trees, I saw a light, dim and distant at first that grew closer and brighter. Soon the white orb was hovering in front of me. Before my very eyes, I watched the light shift and change, ultimately transforming into a large hairy creature. I was amazed at what I just witnessed, but this was only the beginning. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Astounded by the sight, I stood to my feet and dropped the glass wine bottle which shattered into pieces and spilled out onto the forest floor. \"Greetings, do you like this shape?\" the sasquatch asked in a low eerie tone. Despite my best efforts, I was stunned silent and could make no reply. \"Don't you recognize me? I'm what they're all chasing after. I make the knocking noises heard in the distance,\" the sasquatch said. The creature then began to laugh heartily at my frightened and confused expression. The sasquatch walked around me as it continued to look at me. It was almost dancing in its graceful motion. \"Perhaps you'd like this one,\" it said as it suddenly began once more to transform. A sudden sense of awe and religious ecstasy hit me. I was overcome with emotion. \"Lift your eyes up to me, follower!\" she said in a commanding and queenly tone. She extended a hand to me and caressed my face the way a mother might lovingly caress her child. I briefly felt my face go numb as she touched me. It felt somehow more real than real. It's hard to explain, it's like in that moment I realized that I wasn't real and neither was the world around me, but she was. I'd never experienced anything like it before. \"You are in my care, you are in my guidance. You have nothing to fear,\" the goddess said. The goddess before me began to shift rapidly. The next thing I knew she appeared to be the goddess Inanna or Ishtar, then Aphrodite or Venus, then Isis, then Brigid, then Athena again. The shapes moved so quickly that I lost track completely. \"I've seen you there, at your altar, in the dark by candlelight. All those little statues you collect, just more and more of my faces.\" Her arms then went out in the cruciform pose and in a flash of a blindingly bright light she was gone, now replaced by a new form. There stood a scrawny tan outsider in ragged off-white clothing. His robes began to glow whiter than anyone could bleach them and a familiar feeling came over me. \"Hello, my child. Remember me?\" Now I felt like I was five years old again, in those Sunday school lectures I soon grew to despise. \"You don't hate me now, do you?\" he said with a half-smile. Christ's face then started to warp and change until it was unrecognizable. It cycled through various faces like you'd see in any given crowd until it seemed to melt and distort into a disturbing mess of features. The being laughed mischievously. \"See, isn't this fun? I can make you believe every word. I'm pretty good at this. I've been doing it for a very long time.\" \"I can get scary too. Just you wait.\" \"Every good performer has to play a villain sometimes.\" Once again, I felt the feeling that I somehow \"knew\" this being to be pure evil. The only problem was that before I somehow \"knew\" it to be pure good. How, I thought, could my perception be fooled like this so deeply? This being seemed to have complete control and command over my emotions and my senses. There was no discerning the truth beyond these intense experiences. Finally, I managed to speak a single sentence aloud. \"What... are you?\" I said with a look of disgust. \"Why?,\" I asked, \"Why bother tricking humanity?\" \"Despite what some may erroneously believe, I did not create this world. The universe came into existence normally and naturally. I'm just another part of it.\" \"I'm your friend, your father, your mother. I'm your deity, I'm everyone's deity!\" \"I am the UFO of every UFO sighting, the creature of every faery tale. I have taken you to the faery realm, to outer space, to anywhere your mind has wanted to go. All I ask for in return is your belief, your faith, and ultimate ownership of your species.\" “I’m not human, I don’t have any morality, that’s a game your species has invented.” “I’ve watched countless civilizations come and go. I watch human lives twinkle in and out of existence like blinking lights. Sometimes I play you against each other. Your species is a plant that I water with deception until the day that it has fully grown for its greater purpose, for its apotheosis.” “It’s fitting that some people these days call me their shepherd. To me, you are property.” I collapsed to my knees, overwhelmed by it all. I started crying and sobbing. \"Thank you for the offering. I hope I've answered your questions to the best of my ability. Tell your mother to keep praying those prayers. It feeds us.\" With that, the creature vanished right before me. After taking quite a while to compose myself, I left the forest and returned to my aunt's home. In the morning, my aunt's condition took a turn for the worse. Throughout our conversation, she appeared to be in horrible pain and barely hanging on. Then, suddenly, a peaceful expression went across my aunt's face and she smiled. \"I feel a bit better. There's someone else in the room with us,\" she said, looking to the corner as if she was seeing something. I turned but saw nothing. \"Who is it?\" I asked with hesitation. \"...It's Jesus,\" she said happily. A chill went down my spine. Hours later, she slipped away, and I wept bitterly."}

We’re going to see a gathering of Elephant Hawk moths.” “These moths are nocturnal. Do you remember what nocturnal means?” I paused for a moment, rummaging through my disordered memories of our “Live and Kicking” class. “Um… does it mean they come out at night?” “That’s right!” Ms. Hartford beamed with a warm smile. At the time, we didn’t really care for a bunch of moths, but Mr. Aulbin sparked our interest as we walked with him, down the path behind the old brewery. “Has Miss told you anything else about what we’re going to see, boys?” “Just a bunch of insects, right? I hope they don’t land on me,” said Clyde. I never expected him to be the squeamish type when we first met, but that was revealed to me when he screamed to high hell and back after a grasshopper jumped onto his face the previous summer. “Well, yes, it is a bunch of insects. Moths do gather on occasion, but that tends to only happen with ones that come out during the day, and never on the scale we’re about to see. Trust me, just wait and see.” “Why are there so many?” “No one knows. A friend of Mrs. Gillan stumbled onto it taking her dog for a night walk the other day. She said they looked like they were being attracted by something, but that’s it.” “Catch!” Clyde yelled, and I turned to see a stick flying in my direction. I just barely caught it, and before I could even get my bearings he was on me, swinging his own stick like a pirate with a cutlass. “Have at you!” he exclaimed, as I blocked his feral assault with my own weapon. Our battle was short-lived as Ms. Hartford grasped Clyde’s imagined greatsword mid-swipe. “Clyde, behave yourself, or I’ll take you back up to the car park.” He averted his gaze and nodded meekly, setting off again with the rest of the group. The sudden burst of action left me energised, but I bottled it up as well and followed. We were walking along the old fence when we first saw them. I’d expected nothing more than little brown blurs flitting about the air, but the dazzling yellow and pink patterns they sported caught me off guard. I heard Lily cry out in wonder, “look nanny! They’re so pretty!” If the sight of the moths wasn’t incredible enough, a bat zipped by just inches from my face, swiping one of the insects mid-flight and fleeing from view. I heard Alexandra – another classmate – gasp behind me, then let out an upset groan. I never understood why some people were so shocked to see the food chain’s natural cycle, but I’ll cut her some slack. She was only nine, after all. “Hey, Mark, look there!” I heard Clyde whisper from my left. I turned to see his flashlight pointing into the darkness between the pines, just barely illuminating something . I focused on it, and realised it was just more of the moths. Not “just more”, but a lot more. Only faintly illuminated, it appeared as if the hawk moths were swirling in a dense mass, akin to a school of fish, but more tightly packed. “What are they doing?” I found myself asking Mr. Aulbin to my right. “I… don’t know,” he replied after a moment, “it looks like they’re being drawn in by something. Never seen anything like it.” I got no answer. Only the quiet crunching of leaves and twigs as he staggered his way into the trees, and disappeared from my torch light. “C- Clyde?” I looked back to Mr. Aulbin, hoping he would say something, anything. To sternly call Clyde back from the woods and make everything well. But still, he gazed off into the forest, fixated on something I couldn’t see. I tugged at his sleeve, trying to pull his attention, but it was no use. I looked around me to see similarly captivated faces. No one said anything, and the silence was deafening. I began to feel scared, like I wasn’t safe. I heard Mrs. Gillan say, \"so bright… I never thought I’d see you again,” while Lily pulled at her hand frantically, to no avail. She lost her grip and tumbled over backwards, lying there as her grandmother left her alone. “Wait here, children. I’m going to find them and bring them back. Don’t worry, I’ll only be five or ten minutes.” Her voice was shaky, but she was brave nonetheless, and climbed through the fence, vanishing into the all-consuming darkness. And so, we waited. Five minutes. Ten minutes. Thirty. There was no sign of Ms. Hartford, not a single muted shuffle of footsteps. In spite of the warm breeze, I shivered. I felt cold. Hopeless. “Mark? Are you oka-“ “Can we just go home?” “Can we go home what ?” he asked. School was off the next day, but I wasn’t any the happier for it. My parents told me to just rest in my bedroom, play with my toys, that sort of thing. Even if I wanted to go out, who could I meet with? I wasn’t really friends with Jay nor Lily. None of us wanted to leave the safety of our houses, in any case. It was when my stomach began growling that I left my room to go and grab a snack from the kitchen. I paused on the bottom step as I heard low-toned voices conversing in the dining room. “All of them?” “None of them?” “I was told that all they found were-” A floorboard creaked as I shifted my weight, cutting off my mum from whatever she was about to say. “Oh, hello darling! Are you hungry?” “What are you talking about?” My parents looked at each other, communicating through expressions alone. It’s easy to see why they were hesitant to be bearers of morbid news, but I think the lack of closure hurt me the most at the time. It only left my imagination to run amok with the possibilities of what happened to my class. I don’t know where they ended up, but I can only hope they found peace, where I only found questions with no answers. What did they see that compelled them to abandon everything they knew in its favour, and why was I spared? What process occurred that left only hair and nails behind? Where did the rest of them go? So I’ve posted my story here, in hopes someone can shed any light on this, where our cheap flashlights couldn’t on that awful night. Credited to rephlexi0n"}

It's odd that past experiences haven't really affected me today. I can look back to two of the strangest possible things that happened in my childhood, have a beer, and laugh about it - as though it either never happened, or was supposed to have happened, and my subconscious has brushed it off. \"Hey Drew, come here...\" I whispered. He put the game on pause, and started with a pathetic attempt of \"Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named...\" \"Shut the hell up and come here...\" I cut him off. He looked up from the NWA CD that he was wiping on his shirt and looked out the window. \"Over there...\" I pointed at the orange light in the distance. I wasn't sure if it was moving, or if the flutter was some distortion of the hot Texas air. \"The airplane?\" he asked. \"It's not...\" I replied, and he looked at me quizzically. Andrew fell into position beside me and we gazed out over the swaying oaks, at that ball of light in the distance. \"What the hell is it?\" \"It's getting bigger...\" Andrew whispered, his voice betraying alarm. \"No,\" I answered, my voice creaking, \"it's coming towards us.\" \"Outside, now!\" I yelled, impulsively springing to my feet. \"No fucking way!\" Andrew screamed, yet his body betrayed his common sense and scrambled down the staircase behind me. I lept to the front door and out over the porch railing, looking up at the sky. As Andrew came up beside me, my face sank as I realized that I was looking up to nothing more than the clear night sky, the bands of the milky way stretching from treeline to treeline. Nothing. \"What the hell?\" he asked. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\" \"NO!\" I yelled at him. I was not going outside at that point. But I didn't want to stay inside. \"BASEMENT!\" he suggested, out of breath. I nodded, and we careened down the steps, slamming the door behind us. It was roughly 11 PM when the first kid came tearing through the woods into our clearing. His face was the definition of shock as he fell down next to us, panting and whining like a whipped dog. \"There's a light in the field over there and it's CHASING US!\" he screamed. I looked up at the other two guys, who kinda snickered a bit. I glanced back down at the kid, \"It was just a possum or something... their eyes get bright...\" As I said that, three other kids came tearing out of the woods, running over to our campfire. \"No!\" the kid yelled, \"It wasn't a possum...\" \"We'll look...\" I said, walking over towards the treeline. My past history was not on my mind at all, but I still felt an odd chill as I walked towards the trees. My friend behind me called, \"You've got point..\", and I nodded, holding the flashlight up and walking into the woods. Once again, it was completely silent, aside from the dried pine needles crunching beneath my sure footsteps. Then I heard it... the beating of my heart was replaced with short bursts of... speech. \"I... remember...\" I swore I was going crazy, that it was a figment of my imagination. The voice wasn't aural, but I felt it throughout my body, repeating in time with the beat of my heart. \"I... remember... you...\" Original author unknown"}

My best friends were the twins whose backyard came up against my aunt’s yard. There was a park nearby that the four of us would ride our bikes to. We always loved to play there with the old playground equipment, but even as a kid the place seemed off. There were never other people at the park, no matter what time we went, despite being on the edge of a newly built subdivision with plenty of kids. I remember one time, I saw my aunt leaving a little dish with some food scraps in a blue porcelain bowl in the old chimney. I’d never noticed it before, but thinking back, I probably just never noticed it tucked back there. She’d tapped the bowl a few times against the brick and walked us down to play in the creek. One summer, there was a rickety tree house on the cul-de-sac part of the clearing. I remember my aunt and uncle talking about it not long after we found it. The kids who pieced it together were gone, it’d fallen and they didn’t survive. To this day, they’ve never found any remains, nor can I find any records of it happening. As I walked further into the park, the melody seemed to get louder. I was walking towards the entrance to the woods, and it occurred to me that it was someone in the woods singing, not just my fond memories. I snuck up off the trail and followed the noise as quietly as I could. Eventually, I found my singer, standing over by what was left of the old chimney. It was my aunt’s neighbor, though last time I heard she could barely walk, or see for that matter. I sat and watched her. She tapped the bowl inside the fireplace a few times, just like my aunt did. Then I heard gentle clanking of metal. I looked around myself, but nothing appeared out of the ordinary. The trees rattled in the wind, I assumed the fence was rattling. The sound was creeping up on me, but there still wasn’t anything around me. Lydia was gone the next time I looked at the chimney. Out of nowhere, this stench hits me. The closest thing I can compare it to is some mixture of death and excrement. Just off the edge of the trails every now and then I’d spot a small animal skull, usually resting against a tree. I crept along the path, the bones hanging grew in frequency, and started to look more and more carved. I came to a clearing, and there was Lydia. She threw some kind of raw meat into a stone circle and started walking straight towards me. “What is that, Lydia?” “Someone your aunt wanted taken care of.” I heard the rattling of chains behind me. I turned around, but I couldn’t see it. Not on the ground, not in the trees. I turned around. Lydia was gone. I turned and there it was, towering over me. I’m a little over six feet tall, and it was still a couple feet taller. It’s mouth fell open and let out deep groan, the smell should have knocked me over. I called the police from the car, I told them about the bones and where they were. I figured they’d sort out that thing if they found it. I drove to Lydia’s. Everything in the neighborhood was quiet. I banged on the door. Her daughter opened the door. “Hi, is Lydia home?” “She hasn’t been here in a long time.” “Is there any way I can visit with her? I have a few questions about my aunt.” She paused, “Is it about the thing in the park?” I was floored, how did she know? “Yeah, I saw her feeding it or something.” “She told me she’d promised your aunt that she would try to keep him calm.” “Who is it?” “I’m not really sure. She said privately that it may have been your aunt’s son. That thing isn’t human though, is it?” “I don’t think so.” Our conversation was cut short by a phone call. It was the police station. They said I was too old to be making prank calls. Apparently there was a clearing there, but no bones, no burrow. I excused myself from Lydia’s house. If anyone knew what was in those woods, it would be her sister. “Are you sure she didn’t hide him away in the park by her house?” “I love you, but please leave that monster alone. All Genie ever wanted was for that...thing to find a place to live.” Credited to Jaaaaz"}

I would have never thought that my life in itself could have been taken for granted. I look back now and wonder how I could have avoided this but I have yet to find an answer. “Forget something?” the stocky fellow regarded me with a smile. “I’m sorry?” I replied, my eyes furrowed. “You just left thirty minutes ago, sir,” his face showing his confusion as well. “Yes, good to see you again,” his words fell from a smile but they hit like a hammer. “Well, where did it go? Did someone else take it?” I said, anger bubbling up inside me. “Well… yes, no…,” he stammered, his eyes looking from me to the street. “Well, which is it? Yes or no?” my foot tapped in my annoyance. “Well, you did… about five minutes ago sir,” the words coming out as if they didn’t make sense to even him. \"W-who...\", I stammered. \"I'm you pal, well, me now,\" his perfectly sculpted teeth shining behind his curled lips. \"B-but...I'm...Y-you're,\" I tried to reply, my mind unable to comprehend the situation. \"It is time you move on. I have got this from here on out,\" he said, before opening the door to my apartment. \"W-hat...H-how...,\" my eyes blinking rapidly trying to wake from my nightmare. \"Get a life, this one is mine,\" he said before walking into the apartment and shutting the door. When I arrived home I received a warm welcome from my mother, all while my father’s disappointed eyes dug into me from his chair. She offered to make me something to eat, much like always, but I declined. I simply told her I was extremely tired and would just like to rest. She reminded me, as always, where the fresh linens were for the guest room and told me that she would wake me for dinner. After about thirty minutes the phone rang and my mother answered with her normal greeting, her voice just as sweet as ever. Then her voice cracked a bit before listening to the receiver intently. “Oh, ok. I thought you were upstairs honey,” she said. “Who’s on the phone?” my father quizzed. “It’s your son, he’s coming to visit,” she replied. I rushed down the stairs, pulling the phone from my mother’s hand as the both of them looked at me extremely confused. “Who is this?” I yelled into the phone. “I’m coming home, I would suggest you not be there when I arrive,” he said.

Stories are based on a randomly drawn tarot card, and this story's card is \"the Hermit\". Today, fortunately, the old woman filled the bowl with old beef and rice, and Poppy purred and rubbed against her leg to show his contentment. Perhaps if she understood his appreciation, she would not wait so long until next time. He watched the old woman putter around the table aimlessly and wondered what a human thought about all day. Rose noticed some water on the table as she set the lamp down. With her sleeve, she wiped up the moisture, figuring it resulted from the moved cup’s condensation, but after she found a can-opener to open the beans, a droplet plopped down onto the table. The woman looked up, realizing the ceiling must have sprung a- -left a cup on the table? Rose moved the mostly filled glass over to the sink; Michael must have forgotten about it at breakfast time. That was like Michael, to forget his drink out on the table. Returning to the kitchen, she noticed water dripping onto the table. She looked up towards the ceiling, and not seeing anything, slowly climbed onto the table to claim a better view. Holding up the lamp and keeping her frail body balanced on the table, she examined the ceiling, not finding any crack or flaw the water could have escaped from. Frowning, she fetched the glass from the sink and set it below the drip to catch the water. Better than damaging the table, she thought, Michael can look at that too, next time he’s around, or maybe he would be- -left a cup out. She picked the glass up, which looked mostly full of Cola. Michael probably left it out after lunchtime. That was like Michael, to forget his drink out on the table. She dumped the contents down the drain and left the glass face-down in the sink. Poppy meowed. “I fed you just this morning, don’t be pushy.” Generally, Michael could fix most anything, although he never got the bunker clock ticking again. In the early years of their marriage, he would hide out in the garage working on engines and small appliances for some extra money. He treated her poorly in those days, generally neglecting her and disappearing for days on end. Still young and clueless, Rose thought all husbands behaved that way, but his behavior eventually wore her down all the same. She called her sister one night, packed her things, and left for the bus station. Poppy meowed once more. “I just fed you, don’t go trying to trick me like that.” As she moved the cup to the sink, she scrunched up her nose. What stank? Every Tuesday and Thursday, Rose and Michael watched Clara during the summer while her parents worked. What day was today? Rose hoped Clara would come by tomorrow. Living like this for however many years came with an indescribable loneliness, but Rose rarely remembered she was alone anyways, so it didn’t matter much. A moment of clarity came to her then, and she stared into the dark emptiness of the bunker. The stale air stirred gently from the vents. She could hear the fans buzzing. That sounded wrong, so she would have to remind herself to ask Michael to take a look at the ventilation later. Generally, Michael could fix most anything. She turned the lamp off and returned to the kitchen in the dark. Hearing the gentle tap of dripping water, she flicked the lamp back to life, spying a dark liquid settling into a pool on the table. Fearing damage to the wooden surface, Rose hurried to find a towel and wiped out a mess before setting out a cup to collect the leaking water. Looking at the towel, she found it stained a black, with the slightest tinge of red. She examined the ceiling to find it covered it black mold. The liquid dripped from the mass of fungus. How could she clean that up? Maybe some- -there. It looked filled to the brim with ink. She dumped the cup out in the toilet, not wanting to stain the sink. Why would Michael have left a cup of ink out? Clara must have done some painting earlier and used the glass to clean her brushes. Unlike her to forget her art supplies out on the counter though, Wesley would have chided her for such forgetful behavior. Poppy sniffed at the oil lamp, cuddling up against its warmth. Rose missed the days she didn’t rely on the lamp, where she could just flip on the switch and expect the bulbs to light up the bunker. One day they stopped working and no matter how long Michael toyed with the generator, the electricity refused to flow. Light became another resource to conserve, and they spent the days in darkness unless absolutely necessary. Now, Rose realized the remaining fuel would likely out-live her, so she began to burn freely. The cat licked itself in the lamp’s flickering glow. Despite its size, the bunker began to feel small by the second day below ground. At times it became terrifyingly cramped, and with Rose, Michael, Clara, and Maxine all shut away, they constantly found themselves stepping on each other toes. The smell of human odor overtook the small space. Still, Clara smiled, and she retained her positivity right up until the end. Rose shuddered to think when Clara’s cut festered and the infection grew. The girl contorted as the muscle spasms worsened. She would wail in pain, and neither Rose nor Michael could do anything for her. The veteran who built the bunker must have put antibiotics somewhere, and Rose and her husband scoured the place day and night. They found nothing. Clara’s fever overtook her, and Michael buried her in the soft patch of soil in the lowest level of the bunker. Wordlessly, they set a crucifix into the dirt, held each other tight, and sobbed. When Christmas came to the fallout shelter, back when they still kept track of the days and couldn't have marked more than a few dozen, the family gathered around the table and ate the same rations as usual, but Rose encouraged them to sing a few carols. Her husband hated to sing, but Clara convinced him to join in. Black liquid settled on the table besides the cat, who showed no recognition of it. Rose frowned at the leak and quickly set out a cup to collect the drip. How didn’t Poppy notice it? Observing how quickly the cup filled, she thought better of it and replaced the cup with a bowl. She would need to get her husband to look at that. She couldn’t seem to retrieve his name. Funny that it should- -was that. A bowl of black slime sat out on the table, and Rose turned her nose up at it. Grease maybe? She scraped it out into the trash. She placed the bowl back and it collected fluid that dripped from the ceiling. Worrying that the liquid might ruin the bowl, she replaced it with some cheap Tupperware. Rose noticed some greasy stains on the wood beneath the bowl and decided to move the whole table to avoid damaging it. Her hip hurt, but she managed to push the table out of the way anyways. She placed the Tupperware on the floor to collect- -the table gone? Rose noticed the table pushed to the other side of the kitchen and frowned. Why would Michael have moved the table? She almost tripped on the Tupperware container in the center of the floor, and she set down the lamp to see its pitch-black contents. “Don’t complain, Maxine,” Rose said to Poppy as he meowed at her, and she glanced at the thin black cat, but it looked very different now. For the last few days the cat would moan at the vents, like it wanted to alert Rose to something there. It stopped without reason. After they entered the bunker, the ground shook, and the door refused to open. She found a mop and tried to clean. Grime seemed to pour from the walls, dripping down from above. Rose wanted to turn on the lamp to assess the damage, but Michael says they need to conserve oil since they might be down in the shelter for a while. A vaguely humanoid shape hung upside-down from above, stretching from the concrete ceiling and dripping sludge to the floor. Rose could barely see it in the sparse light, and she noticed Poppy sitting in the corner of the kitchen. The cat showed no reaction to the thing. Poppy couldn’t see it at all. Rose came closer, and the growth shifted towards her. It wore someone’s face. She knew the face belonged to someone important, but she couldn’t recognize it at all. A limb extended from the mass and it caressed her. Leaning close, she could feel its wet breath against her features, and everything came apart at th- As hunger gnawed at the cat, Poppy visited the human. He stopped by occasionally to check up on her, but she just sat in the corner of the kitchen, entirely immobile. He rubbed up against her leg, but she refused to acknowledge him. Typical. Hopping up on her lap, he pressed into her, missing the days she would make light."}

Believe me, dearest, he has more dignity and seriousness (of the kind, I mean, which is not inconsistent with a manner sometimes playful and always charming) than any of the men that you and I ever met. And young Raynor—you knew Raynor at Monterey—tells me that the men all like him and that he is treated with something like deference everywhere. There is a mystery, too—something about his connection with the Blavatsky people in Northern India. Raynor either would not or could not tell me the particulars. I infer that Dr. Barritz is thought—don't you dare to laugh!—a magician. Could anything be finer than that? The possibility that neither might be agreeable seems not to have occurred to him. Did you ever know such assurance? Assurance? My dear, it was gall, downright gall!

I toss and turn in my bed, trying to find a comfortable spot, but I feel uneasy. Something about tonight just doesn't feel right. Knock. Knock. Instantly, the silence is shattered. My mind fills with fearful thoughts as my startled eyes flash open. It’s almost undoubtedly the sound of a fist on glass. But no, it couldn’t be - why would someone purposefully wake up another person alone in their home? Think logically. If someone wanted to break in, they wouldn't warn me with a knock. They would just break in, making a loud and obvious noise, or be as silent as possible. Why would they knock? Knock. Knock. Nope, that definitely wasn’t my imagination. Those damn kids are persistent. They don’t want to quit until they get that reaction. Maybe some sick, twisted freak is standing outside, waiting for me to look so he can smash through and attack me. No, don’t think that. Don’t get paranoid. Besides, he’s outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe. Monsters don’t exist. I haven’t moved yet. Hopefully those kids will think I’m a heavy sleeper and leave me alone. Knock. Knock. No, it can’t be kids. No kid would wait around this long just to get a reaction from one lonely guy; they’d get bored and move along. So what could it be? Why would a serial killer target me, of all people? Think logically. Monsters don’t exist. Don’t get paranoid. They’re outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe. But if it’s not a monster or some sort of killer, what could it be? Just pretend to be asleep and maybe they’ll go away. Knock. Knock. Oh God, I can’t think of a noise I hate more than that persistent knock! Please go away! Just leave me alone and let me be! There’s no hope. It’s going to get in here and do sick and horrible things to me. Inhale. Take deep breaths. I can feel my heart pounding out of my chest. Just relax. Monsters don’t exist. Remember: they’re outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe. Repeat that. Don’t let your fear get the best of you. Just pretend to be asleep. Don’t move a muscle. Knock. Knock. They’re outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe. Monsters don’t exist. Just pretend to be asleep and pray it’ll go away. Knock. Knock. They’re outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe. Frightful tears begin to drip down my face. Monsters don’t exist. Monsters do not exist. I begin to whisper to myself. “They’re outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe. They’re outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe.” Knock. Knock. “They’re outside, I’m inside. Until I hear a shatter, I know I’m safe.” Original author unknown"}

We wondered why he would go out at this time of day, but we shrugged it off as that he liked to take late strolls. So, we watched as he left. He closed and locked the door. We returned to our rooms, and continued to play video games. After some time talking and playing, strange things began to happen. I remember it was when my brother told me a joke, I can't remember exactly what about, I think it was an about a cat, when the first of the odd things happened. This strange happening, what my family now considers the \"First Sign\", was a strange whispering sound. When I heard it, I didn't know what it was, so I thought it was a prank my brother was pulling to creep me out a bit. So, I decided to play along with it. I, being the ignorant 5 year old I was, didn't notice the discomforted face on my brother."}

I was going to hell for not going to church on Sundays, or not believing in her religion for that matter. I was going to hell for eating meat. I was going to hell for listening to rock music. I was going to hell for having interest in men. I watched her carefully stack her clay pots on a tray, preparing to have them brisk fired. On top of being a controlling monster, she was also an overachiever, bent on being better than everyone else. This meant long extended hours outside of the classroom. Of course she would be here, working on making her clay pot picture perfect. It didn't matter how long I spent on my work, she would always put me down, accusing me of blowing it off or not paying close enough detail to my work. Not everyone was anal about craftsmanship. I sure didn't care and not caring about something was like a sin to her. Even though it wasn't her business she acted as if I was some kind of horrible disgrace, not fit enough to be in a BFA program. She wasn't in that degree of course, things weren't that ridiculously cliché. She was an Art History major who took fine art in clay as a minor. Some times I really felt she was resentful for me making into the BFA program, not that she wanted to be apart of it, but more because she seemed determined to see me as a failure. I crept around the kiln and slowly shut the door, feeling excited as I did so. There was a creaking sound, but she was so engulfed in her obsessive vision of making her work in picture perfect order, that she didn't notice. In fact I stood there for a few long minutes waiting for her to yell out or complain to open the door. You see, there was no way out once the door was shut. This was a horrible error in a product design. Not only that, but it also locked from the outside. I stepped back tormented with the idea that I might be making a mistake, but even if it was a mistake no one needed to know. Deep down I don't think it would really bother me if I went through with it, with no guilt and shame. No, I really think I would feel better, free even. There was also the obvious reality that there really wouldn't be that much left of her once the kiln was finished. If that was the case then all that needed to be done was a quick sweep and to dump the contents into the clay mixer, so that she would become usable clay, though undoubtedly mocking me still by maintaining a level of importance."}

Everything was in perfect order and not a speck of dust could be seen. “Ah, she must’ve spent the day cleaning again,” you tell yourself as you remove your shoes.

The door to the bedroom was slightly ajar, allowing some light to shine through. You peek into the room and see her soundly asleep. The thin sheets wrapped around her body outlined her delicate figure. Her bosom, which slowly rose and fell with every breath she took, gave her the appearance of a serene goddess, so peaceful, so innocent, so vulnerable… You undress and slide the covers off of her. “She’s a keeper,” you tell yourself."}

It still sends chills down my spine whenever I think about it. Let me explain. Surprisingly, it turned out to be a link without punctuation. It was still a mass of letters, but the http:// and .com were too hard to ignore. So, I got some free antivirus and prepared for the worst. So, I pressed X to select it and it cut to another black screen for about four seconds. The premise of the game was simple—run from a pack of wolves or die by getting eaten, which turned out to be pretty fun. I didn't really see this as creepy, but then again I'm not one of these paranoid creepypasta protagonists. After eventually being chased down and killed a couple times, I noticed something after the fifth death, though. The screens where the wolves could be seen eating you were getting longer, and the character grew thinner and thinner and got slower. The wolves would stay the same speed, however. Selecting this simply brought the camera back to the wolves eating the boy, but it lasted about a minute. Afterwards, the wolves turned away to show the skeleton of the boy, mostly picked clean. Trying again would simply pan to the skeleton for a minute while the wolves howled. And occasionally, while I do other things, I will hear howls from my speakers, or sometimes, even a snarl."}

What the - ” “Are you quite sure, Alvan?” “My dear, do you suppose a man does not know when he is carrying a jug? I bought that sirup at Deemer’s as I was passing. Deemer himself drew it and lent me the jug, and I - ” Mrs. Creede stood by her husband, regarding him with surprise and anxiety. “For Heaven’s sake,” she said, “what ails you?” Mr. Creede’s ailment having no obvious relation to the interests of the better land he did not apparently deem it necessary to expound it on that demand; he said nothing - merely stared. There were long moments of silence broken by nothing but the measured ticking of the clock, which seemed somewhat slower than usual, as if it were civilly granting them an extension of time in which to recover their wits. “Alvan,” she said, “you have given no evidence of insanity, believe me. This was undoubtedly an illusion - how should it be anything else? That would be too terrible! But there is no insanity; you are working too hard at the bank. You should not have attended the meeting of directors this evening; any one could see that you were ill; I knew something would occur.” “Doubtless the phenomenon was subjective,” he said, with a somewhat ludicrous transition to the slang of science. “Granting the possibility of spiritual apparition and even materialization, yet the apparition and materialization of a half-gallon brown clay jug - a piece of coarse, heavy pottery evolved from nothing - that is hardly thinkable.” As the full import of that revelation imparted itself to Alvan Creede’s understanding he visibly shuddered. For the child could not have heard a word of the conversation. The effect upon the crowd was marvelous. It began rapidly to melt away at both flanks, as the timid left the place. Many ran as fast as their legs would let them; others moved off with greater dignity, turning occasionally to look backward over the shoulder. At last a score or more, mostly men, remained where they were, speechless, staring, excited. The apparition inside gave them no attention; it was apparently occupied with a book of accounts."}

As I said my life was good but not great. Then one day my dog, Ace, a beautiful dark grey husky, ran away. A neighbor took him out when I was stuck at work and when a cab stopped short, he got loose and ran off into the park. Ace was a present from Isabel, he meant the world to me. I rushed home but by the time I reached the park, it was dark and every New Yorker knows, you never go into the park after dark. It would have to wait… The next two weeks were a blur of wakes, funerals and mountains of paperwork. I was drained, empty inside and with a heavy heart I flew back home. I looked for him several times but I never found him. I took some time off work and spent a lot of time alone. I would drink and sleep, drink and sleep my life stuck in a cycle of shit. I became cold, distant, angry… I was angry at everyone, I was angry at God. Why would he take everything from me and in a rage I stood up and yelled at the heavens “What the fuck did I do to deserve this?” Nothing but silence. This time, someone responded. I heard a whisper come from behind my door. I look at the clock it was 3am. I moved towards the door and I heard the whisper again. So soft it was almost not there. I leaned into the door to try to listen but I still couldn't hear it, so I pressed my ear to the door. “I can give them back to you.” I walked back into my apartment slowly making sure no one snuck up on me and shut the door and then I heard it. The unmistakable sound of him. It was Ace I knew his bark anywhere. I ran to the window and there he was out in the street barking up at the window. I rushed to the door grab my coat, his leash and ran out after him. I heard Ace barking and barking; waiting for me… I could barely see the lights of the dark being dim, some broken, he barked and barked and I rushed after him, he led me deeper and deeper into the park. He ran up a small hill turned and bark down at me. As I walked up he stopped and a warm glow seem to grow behind him. I slowed and peered over the edge. “You have a good dog, very brave.” “Thank you….Did you take care of him?” “In a way…” He turned the squirrel over to the other side. “Well again, thank you, is there something I can do for you? Some kind of reward?” “My reward is forth coming, just a request needs to be filled” “A request?” “Yes, you’re going to need a guide…” I took a step back, Ace stood and moved with me. “Your dog has decided to join you, he wants you to be happy…” I took another step back, right to he edge of the hill. “What do you mean?” The man stood and turned to face me, his face was a pale blue, his eyes completely black, hundreds of tiny barely healed scars covered his face. “You cannot leave until the choice has been given. You can go home, you can take your dog and live your life, or you can come with me and I can give you a chance, a single chance to fix things, to set things right.” “What do you mean?” I said cautiously but curiously. “What if I could let you see your parents again? Your sister?” “No one can do that.” “I can, they need your help, you trapped them somewhere. Only you can help them.” “Wait, there is one more thing. I have a question that you must answer.” “The woman you loved…what would you do to see her again? to feel the warmth of her skin? To feel the taste of her lips?” “Anything.” “Would you kill?” “Is that your answer?” The man stood and walk to the large store, he forcefully and violently slamed his hands into the stone and began to pull it apart. A crude smell, of blood and death seeped through stone. As he drew back the opening, larger and larger, a blistering heat could be felt and a light started to pour through. He took my hand and dragged me closer. The heat growing more and more intense, I could barely stand it. I stood there, motionless, the heat vanished, I felt nothing but a deep chill course through my body. What should I do? Should I follow? What did he mean about my family? Isabel, my sweet Isabel, could this have something to do with her? Ace walked into the darkness, vanishing into the distance. Then I was alone; there was nothing but darkness around me or the darkness before me. I was alone again. I’m safe where I am, but something is drawing me forward, something is calling me in. Ace barks. I can’t leave him alone. I enter, letting the darkness engulf me. I hear it. “You’re mine now…” END OF CANTO 1"}

Those were just my initial thoughts at the time. \"My name is John Astly. I am eighteen years old.\" After that, the black mist follows you wherever you go.

I shall make my last stand as one of the very last humans left, if not the last entirely.

This journal is a warning to us all of what has yet to come. I only hope that this world shall never know the suffering that is spoken of in this journal, and although I may not be a religious man by any means, I pray to God every night that this shall never happen here. I don't know if I completely believe it though, but I do know this; should it be real, should the monster actually exist and we have only yet to awaken it, then, if the world powers do ever go to war that could spell the end for all life as we know it."}

It was active when those of neighboring counties found that this small encampment housed gold in its caves. Other towns started to rid it of its foreigners and their workingmen classes. They settled here in our once quiet, humble town. But if there was anything that I enjoyed the most in this otherwise uneventful town were the hangings that took place occasionally. It was rather difficult to explain why. There was always this strange, if not rather crude, sense of justice being done whenever it happened. It felt almost empowering. He was a gleaner, trying to scavenge any riches that were perhaps overlooked by the busy miners. Out of all races that this town didn't take kindly to, the Chinese were treated the roughest, and the most unfair. Naturally, my friends and I did what any other group of kids of our age and of our understanding would have done. The Chinaman was kneeling over where we saw him last still. He appeared to be crying. The bloodthirsty mob started to surround him. Out of the crowd, I noticed that one of them was my own father with a slipknot clutched in his busy fists, glaring over. His eyes spoke unmeasurable levels of anger and hatred. Before the mob was able to get a hold of him, the law arrived quickly at the scene from the entire ruckus. The police took the Chinaman and dragged him out before any harm could befall him. The sheriff told the crowd that he would be given a fair trial before any punishment would be dished out. There was only one prison in the area. It was small, as usually it would only hold prisoners overnight to transfer them elsewhere – or hang them the next day, which was planned for our poor Chinaman in question. The jailhouse was a very durable one. It certainly would never go anytime soon, but neither did its occupants during its time. Only one person ever escaped it. Somehow not considered to be dangerous in any way beside the bullet entering my leg, the Chinaman wasn't shackled to the floor. Back home, my father was in disgust about how a “fucking chink” would dare shoot his son. How he wished a violent death upon the man and his loved ones. Being young and full of guilt for what happened that day, I said nothing to him. I couldn't find my voice of reason. My father got drunk that evening, his rambling becoming slurred and threatening towards the Chinese. My father left the house a few hours later, stumbling out the door and carrying something in his hand. I followed him without his knowing. After he gathered his equally drunken friends, they walked towards the jail. The first thing the group did was tie the guards that were in the jail first, although there was nothing done to them physically beside very small struggles. It was obvious that the prison guards were not their target. It took several minutes for the pack of predators to find their prey. Concealing the rope behind his back, my father lied to him smoothly and revealed to him leaves of tobacco. The man, trusting this as a token of apology, reached out his hand in between the bars. With sudden surprise, the crowd yanked the man’s hand and pulled him closer to the prison bars. My father’s noose was quickly wrapped and collared around his neck. With bestial rage, the horde tugged and pulled on the rope with combined strength as the Chinaman struggled and began to asphyxiate, trying to pull the knot off around his neck futilely. Gold started to vanish soon after the incident in the jail. The wealth of the land was quickly swept away along with the gold rush. The only thing that remained from it was the blood on that wall. It never dried up; the cell wall was still painted a dark crimson color to this day. My father would come home every day after a long drink at the bar. He was never tried for murder, but every day I could sense the guilt in his eyes. Eventually, his health deteriorated. He eventually was swallowed into his alcoholism. No tears came to my eyes when he passed. The only thing I could hope for is that he could be forgiven."}

This story combines a personal account with transcriptions from a recorded audio interview. I could hardly move at first, my muscles were so weak. I looked around the dark hospital room. I saw old “Get Well Soon” cards on the stand by my bed, along with a miniature Christmas tree complete with LED lights. It was snowing outside, and the hospital window was frosted over. “It’s Christmas…” was one of my first waking thoughts. The proceedings were as you’d expect. Some of the hospital staff took a break that morning to give me a little celebration. I repeatedly answered questions about how I felt, underwent a few tests, and got my arms stretched and spun around so they could give me an estimate on how much physical therapy I’d need. A reporter from the local paper even came in for a small interview, for a blurb that would be printed the next day. I threw up some water and soft food after my first attempt at putting something in my stomach after so many years. Well… I wanted to be done. I fought the temptation as much as I could. But it’s like a curse. There’s been a latent need in me, planted way back in my childhood through no fault of my own. All because my parents drove me past a certain area in Florida, and tragedy followed shortly after and triggered a false memory that turned into a subconscious parasitic virus, its roots ever deepening. I began my physical therapy the next day, but my muscles felt like Jell-O, and at first it seemed that I wasn’t making any progress. But I knew the sooner I could walk normally again, the sooner I would get to go home. “Hey, there he is,” Jack said as he entered, wearing a dorky sweater. “Hey, bud. You doing better?” “New look?” I asked. “Oh. Switched to contacts recently.” Tyler was next, sort of sliding into the room cautiously, his security blanket hoodie up and covering his hair. Always socially awkward. Not that I didn’t have some respect for the guy, pushing forward the investigation into a phantom organization we knew almost nothing about while I was out of the picture. “Tyler,” I said for my simple hello. “Yoooo…” He said and fidgeted in place. The four of us really didn’t have much in common, other than having grown up in Florida and getting exposed to a memory-making and altering device as kids, and then suffering hardships shortly thereafter. It wasn’t long until the pointless small talk began, just to fill up the time. But I broke that up pretty quickly. “Guys, it’s all right,” I assured them. “We can talk about what we all want to really talk about.” “You sure?” Tyler asked. “I mean… After what happened, we didn’t know if…” Tyler looked the most relieved. He was certainly not that great at casual conversation, and I could tell that he was itching to get to the conspiracies. He perked up and asked, “You talked to Boris yet?” “Sure,” I told them. “But he’s not in town. Of all the weeks to be away, right?” “Heard he was down in Miami, trying to get a flight to Cuba,” Jack said. “It hasn’t been easy since restrictions got reimplemented.” “Feels like the world’s gone crazy while I was in a coma,” I replied with a groan. “And what’s this about you two going to Ukraine ?” “That was back in summer. It… Um, yeah, I’ll tell you later. I’m still working on getting my account of what went down just right.” “He’s barely told us anything,” Tyler said. “So you’re not missing much so far.” “And why is he trying to get into Cuba again?” Kate wondered. “It’s a part of Cold War history, sure, but what… specifically is he looking for?” “To record it?” I asked her. “The ever-present wireless signals and electrical fields,” Jack said with a grunt. I couldn’t explain either the science or the reasoning behind it, but these theories seemed sensible enough. There was just one piece of the puzzle I didn’t think any of us would be able to explain. Strange to think that such an innocuous snapshot of some plastic blocks put together in childhood could pass on a foreboding mystery so many years later. I was actually hard-pressed to tell him that there couldn’t possibly be any truth to that. And while the rest of us didn’t have any other explanations for the time line of my life events, Tyler did bring another theory to the table with his rant. The worst days of our lives… An early warning station… “What if we all started thinking nice, pleasant thoughts about an amusement park as the nuclear holocaust came knocking?” I asked the others, while trying not to sound overly serious about it. “Or am I just talking crazy here?” “Opiate of the masses?” Jack wondered. Tyler muttered, “More like the pleasant film of flowers you get to watch before they turn you into Soylent Green …” “All interesting theories, but it wouldn’t explain the why,” Boris said. “What would the government, or some secret organization, stand to benefit by giving everyone a good memory just before they burned up in a fiery shock wave?” We changed subjects, hung out and talked about our lives for a bit, got back to the stories—I think just to get another dopamine hit that came with each new possible theory—and then called it a day. They were all staying in town only briefly, which I understood given the time of the year. For me, it was nice enough just to see everyone, and wanting to be seen by them despite the cost of a plane ticket up here. I felt even more compelled to work hard on my physical therapy; the sooner I got back to Florida, the sooner I’d make visiting these guys easier, seeing as how they all still lived within driving distance. “So… I just started seeing this girl,” he told me. “No, no… I just… I wanted to tell someone else, you know? I don’t, uh, have many friends. And I’m nervous I’ll screw it up before anyone else finds out.” “Well, try not to be. I’m sure she likes you for who you are.” Sorry, buddy. I also have access to the site, remember? We all started talking to each other every day after the visit. I liked the lot of them, even if we didn’t have all that much in common. It felt like we all could’ve been friends back in high school or college if given the chance. And when I wasn’t doing that, I was catching up on a few of the PC games that came out in the past few years. Nice bonus—and an improvement from my last gaming experience. They also helped me exercise, at least mentally. “Interview Request,” was the subject title. I thought it was just another local media company getting in touch with me again. “Your series of stories began with one about a group of young friends who played a fateful game of laser tag. And then someone put a journal online about it, and you stumbled upon and kept it up for years, maybe in hopes of its original author finding it. Well, here I am. That journal shares my experience, about the day that ruined the lives of a few kids in a quiet neighborhood. “I’m not too far away. I could visit you tomorrow night, if you’re up for it. I’d really like to meet. I can’t promise I’ll have any answers for you, but I’m certain you’d want a fresh take on the day when all of this began.” I agreed to meet him, and we set up an interview on a Saturday night. And even though I knew it wasn’t really a good idea, I let him record us, just as long as he promised not to mention any names—and that, preferably, he’d down-pitch my voice or disguise it a bit somehow. I recorded our conversation as well, to make sure I’d have a copy for our use. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. And… um, again, congrats. For waking up after four years. That must’ve been… quite an experience. One I wish I didn’t have. Would’ve been better if I didn’t dream at all. Oh, so… you, and the rabbit… Mister, um, Fun Bunn… The Electric Rabbit more times than the others, actually. So you know what he’s like. I didn’t exaggerate anything. The game was enough to send shivers down spine, but the dreams… How did you beat him? And wake up? If that’s what happened. Wow. That’s just… That’s incredible. I mean, the lost technology alone that can do that. Then again, that’s kind of what’s at the heart of these stories. So you believe them? Hard not to when it started with my own. Where are you going from here? Are you going to find these people, hunt them down? We aren’t sure what we’d do if we ever found them. If there’s anyone left, we’d ask them hundreds of questions, but after that? Never really talked about it. Me [after a lengthy pause] I found it very… interesting. Relatable. Maybe even plausible. Hm. Or, you just like a good… creepypasta, it’s called, right? Campfire stories for the modern age, yeah. I thought it was a good one, so I put it on a personal website I ran briefly, along with dozens of other stories from obscure websites that I didn’t want to disappear from the internet entirely. And what happened to that website? Me [I let out a sigh] My host terminated it. Never gave me an explanation. The only reason that story survived at all, was because I also put it on the official creepypasta wiki first, which I guess ‘they’ haven’t been able to shut down. It was my favorite saved story, and the only one I shared elsewhere. I lost the other ones. Do you think it was that story that got your site removed? I can’t explain why, but yeah, I always did kind of feel that way. Nearly every part of me believed it was just another scary story, and yet… I really did feel connected to it somehow. I mean, I couldn’t tell you why, but— Your experience with Kiddie Land? Justin [he gives me a wry smile] I know exactly what you mean. Still, you must’ve just thought at first that my story was just another story, until one thing led to another after you shared it. What got you into the genre, anyway? What do you like about it? The things we couldn’t control in the past and can’t undo. I didn’t know this stuff could get so philosophical. Is that the title of a piece of music? Were you looking for a piece of yourself in these stories? Maybe there’s something to that. I was afflicted by the memory of something I couldn’t explain, after all. All right. I got all of that out. What about you? Sure, but did you really find the set in a Goodwill of all places? Why not? I bet it’s actually sort of refreshing. I’m guessing most of the ‘cursed objects’ in these stories are found in a dusty old thrift store, or in some forgotten box in a basement or attic. I’ll never be able to explain how it got there, or who once owned it. So, I’ve given up trying. Saves me some grief. It’s not your fault, you know. No matter what Peter said to you when he was angry. You couldn’t have known what would happen, not for sure. [I remember feeling like I came out of left field with that remark, or that I was suddenly trying to speak with him too personally. I think I really just wanted to gauge his reaction, which was a fake cough and a brief painful grimace that came from remembering a distressing moment.] That is… what I’m always trying to tell myself. [This was about the time I first really took notice of his facial twitch, which popped up every few minutes. For a nervous tic, it was fairly pronounced.] Brian, Gil, Nick, Devin, Peter, and me. We were a good group of buds. Sorry I didn’t change your names. I wasn’t doing it yet back then for the stories. I think everyone eventually drifts apart with at least a few childhood friends. I went to my own childhood neighborhood not long before my visit to Boris’s. It was dry, and hot. No breeze. It was like the air was weighing on me. What was it like to handle those laser guns? I remember their weight, like holding a real weapon. It’s the vest I always think about more. Just… strapped on, waiting to explode… I’ve wondered what it must be like to get vaporized like that. A brief moment of intense pain, then nothing, before you have time to even think about what happened to you… I’ll fast forward about fifteen minutes in the recording, at which point he suddenly returned the topic back to the stories.] And who do you think… did all these things? We don’t know. We don’t have a name, or motives. Is it just a collection of science experiments gone wrong that escaped a lab? Um, something like that, I guess. Well, come on. Give me your theories. I want to see how clear a picture you’ve got. I asked for an interview, but you can consider me your newest fan. Me [after a pause to collect my thoughts] Justin [he smiles] Interesting ideas. But why? Why else? People do sick things all the time. I think it’s a little more complicated than that. Want my take? Sure, the Soviets probably saw a new way instill more fear in America. By the 80s, the red scare and fear of communist takeover wasn’t working out so well anymore. Gen X was growing up listening to punk rock and not taking any of the old tactics seriously. Their parents grew up learning how to duck and cover, and filling the family’s useless bomb shelter with crap that wouldn’t fit in the garage. Soviets couldn’t even make it to the moon, so what was there to be so afraid of? North Vietnam won, an unpopular war ended, but the world didn’t. They didn’t expect the East to collapse overnight, sure, but Russia wasn’t the same boogeyman to kids a bit older than us, that it was to their parents. By going after the literal kids on the block, right? [He leaned in closer across the table] The real question is, how did the ‘engine’, as you call it, end up on both sides? Both were developing technology around it too closely together on the timeline. We’re not talking on the scale needed to reverse engineer something, or to learn how it works and start from scratch. Nah. Someone was playing East and West. Some other party sold the strange, exotic technology to both countries. There’s really only one thing I wanted to ask you in any serious way. What do you know about the person you and your friends seem to call ‘Umbrella Man?’ Huh? What do… Don’t get me wrong, I like the title. A little vague, but ominous. Allusions to JFK’s assassination. But do you really know nothing about him? He’s only popped up a couple times in the stories. It’s not like we have much to go on. Hm. All right. [At this point, he looked at me another ten seconds or so, and then suddenly stopped recording on his phone. I did the same, assuming our talk was over, abrupt an ending that it was.] Even so, I did have vague suspicions about the guy and his real reason for visiting. Against my better judgment, I stood from my chair—still not the easiest feat for me at the time—and shambled my way over to the nearby bathroom door, just to check if he was maybe talking to someone. It turned out, he was. But it was just himself. “You can’t do this,” I heard him saying. “No matter what he did to you. It doesn’t matter what he did to you. I don’t care, it’s still wrong, it won’t fix anything. Can’t think straight, can’t think…” Poor guy sounded like he was having a mental breakdown, but now I was concerned that he was conflicted about doing something to me . I heard him rip out a paper towel, and figuring he was about to come out, I shuffled over to the vending machines to make it look like I was just here to look at the snacks. He was a nervous wreck when he stepped out and saw me. “Oh, uh… T-thanks for meeting with me, but it’s getting late. I better go.” “Keep in touch, okay?” I asked him. “I’d like to talk some more.” “Yeah. Sure, okay. I’ll do that.” I couldn’t go to bed without telling someone else about my meeting, and my first choice was Tyler, knowing he’d never mind being texted in the later hours. I turned off my room’s light, sat up in my bed, and got on my phone. Justin. From the original laser tag story. Serious? If true, holy crap. How’d you find him? Hurry up and send the file. I want to listen to it right away. I listened. Something isn’t right with this guy. I get that he still has some form of PTSD, but the way he’s talking to you, and what he’s saying, is concerning. Can you describe his looks? [I wasn’t sure how to respond at first, and wondered what he was getting at.] Sullen expression. Dark black hair. Blue eyes. I’ve got that story memorized. Peter has blue eyes. It describes them right near the beginning. Dirty blond hair, not black, but that can be easily changed. Don’t know about Justin’s eyes, but now I’m more worried. You’re saying it’s actually Peter? Why would he lie about that? None of the reasons would be good ones. Shit. There was something strange about his hair, now that I think about it. Maybe it was dyed. Watch out for this guy, man. Tell the staff you don’t want any more visitors. If that’s really Peter, he’s probably even less stable than Justin would be. Hey? You still there? Send me a reply. You’re scaring me here. “Sorry,” he told me at my bedside as I lost consciousness. “I’m sorry.” I barely managed to sputter out, “What… What did you…” “I gave you a small dose of a powerful concoction,” he told me, and then checked his mechanical watch. “It’s about two in the morning. I wanted it to be just us, so I knocked out the orderlies, nurses, and other staff in this ward, too. Bigger doses, so they probably won’t wake up until sunrise, at the earliest.” “Guess you figured it out. Yeah, it’s me. Sorry about the deception. If it makes any difference, I enjoyed our talk. We’re a lot alike.” “Why are you…” “Justin was the only one of us that actually believed me at all. The others called me crazy when I told them what happened to my brother. They shunned me.” “I’m sorry. I’m sure people have tried to help you, but give me a chance. I actually do believe it.” “Hm. That’s what so many others have told me over the years. You know… The thing I always hated the most in horror movies, is when no one listens to the main character when they’re trying to warn everyone about the lurking danger. The audience is usually on their side, after all. We saw the same thing they did.” “Peter, don’t… do whatever you’re trying to do,” I continued, trying to get him to think I was on his side, or at least reach him in some way. “Do you know what it’s like to go through that in the real world, for years? To be told repeatedly that your brother might still be out there? You didn’t vaporize him, Pete. You imagined it. You experienced trauma. It happens. It’s not your fault, stop blaming yourself, the police found nothing wrong with the toy…” “There are security cameras all throughout the building. They’ll see it. And if they don’t get it out there, I will. I’ll find the security office and make a copy.” I felt my heart trying to beat out of my encumbered chest. Peter raised up his right hand to show me what he was holding. It was a piece of black molded plastic, with rusted metal trimmings. An old laser gun from the ’80s, in rough condition—there was even some duct tape keeping it all together. “I’m not going to just shoot you while you’re still in bed,” he told me. “I just want one last game. I’m hoping maybe the thrill of it will make me feel something again, especially… now that I know what a ‘critical hit’ will do.” “What the hell do you want me to do?” I asked him. “You want me to shamble around the hospital while you shoot at me?” “That wouldn’t be any fun for either of us. Look, it’s not personal. He sent me here to find out what you know, and then deal with you. But I have my own issues that I need to work out, too.” “Clearly. And who the hell are you talking about?” “I think you know. I have vests of my own, and I’ll wear them. If you can find the second laser gun I hid somewhere… Maybe you’ll still have a chance.” “And you think that will make this ‘fun.’ You want the excitement. Just a few hours ago, we were talking about how you can’t revisit your childhood.” Peter sighed and began to back out of the room, keeping his gun pointed at me all the while. “I’ll give you five minutes to get out of that bed. Then I’m going to come looking. Whoever wins… Well, if it’s you, promise me you’ll at least get the story out.” As long as I carried the vests with me, they’d render any other electronics useless. If only I could find something that would cut through the chains. It’s a hospital , I thought. There should be something in one of the rooms where they do surgery . I would’ve risked using a bone saw if it meant getting the death contraptions off of me. The problem was this ward probably didn’t have any such tools, since it just held long-term patients. I could easily cover up the single laser sensors on my sides, but it meant walking sideways down the halls for that protection—moving like a crab would just slow me down further. And then what if Pete was waiting for me in one of the patient’s rooms? I would leave my front and back vulnerable to a sudden shot from somewhere inside those darkened places. Halfway down the hall, as lights flicked off and my dome of darkness followed me, I looked back and noticed the lights by the receptionist desk flickering. Peter might’ve been back there, but I couldn’t see him in the dark that would’ve surrounded him. The damn lights would always give our positions away, yet also make it harder to see each other. I walked backwards the rest of the way, keeping my eyes focused on the spot of darkness, trying to find Peter inside it. I kept going, covering as much of the three sensors on my front as I could with my hands, leaving only slivers of the metal sensor plates exposed between my fingers. I crossed the width of the hallway and ducked into a nearby empty room. I grabbed the bed’s blanket, wrapped it tightly around myself to cover up all of the sensors, and then returned to the hall. I was fairly confident the invisible laser wouldn’t be able to pierce the layers of fabric. “Tch, that’s no fun,” he said with a sigh. “Why do you have to try and cheat?” “Pete, listen to me,” I told him and backed away a few feet so he couldn’t make a grab for my safety blanket. “I want to help you. You don’t have to do this.” He was beginning to piss me off again, so I dropped the nice act and fired back, “You want to talk about cheating ? You strap a ton of vests on me after drugging me, don’t give me a gun, and then only wear two yourself. And where did you even get this many, man?” He laughed. Peter frowned, then sighed, then let out an agitated grunt. He dug into his pocket with his left hand, and pulled out a small remote of some sort. “I wish that you would just play along,” he groaned and pressed a button. It suddenly felt like I was on fire. My muscles seized up as my entire body was shocked. The voltage was so strong, that the metal chains wrapped around me shot out sparks. I dropped the blanket and hit the floor, where I convulsed helplessly. I couldn’t tell what was electrocuting me. I reached around to my back as much as I could while in tremendous pain, but I only felt the vests. After around six or seven agonizing seconds, Peter released the button and knelt down while my heart raced and I tried to shrug off the lingering burning sensation. Stuck on the floor, the only thing I could think of to ask in that moment was, “How long have you been planning all this?” “A few years. You took your time waking up. Didn’t expect your friends to keep at it in your absence, though. Now, can we start over? You got five minutes.” “ Pew, pew!” I heard a sudden taunt behind me. “ At least if I die, it’ll be fast ,” I remembered thinking. Then again… “Darn, couldn’t quite hit ya,” he said with a laugh after I took cover by the open door. “All right, all right. You keep going wherever you’re going and I’ll come out of hiding once you’re gone.” “One minute, and I’m coming back after you!” Peter yelled out, probably thinking I was farther down the hall. “Son of a bitch! ” he shouted as he looked up at me and checked to see if his nose was broken. “Not cool , man! Not a contact sport!” I saw him reaching into his pocket for the remote again, but he was in a bit of a daze and fumbled it about. I turned and continued down the hall as quickly as I could, hoping I could get out of range before he pressed the button. That didn’t work. The remote might’ve reached a hundred feet for all I knew. He shocked me, and I fell to the floor. But he only kept the electricity flowing for a few seconds this time. Could be he felt that getting a punch in the face wasn’t as severe as covering up all my vests, or he was just rooting for me to actually find my laser gun before the night ended. I got back up and pushed myself towards the x-ray room, now just feet away. “Look, I get it, you’re desperate,” Peter said behind me, his voice now a bit nasally. “I put you in a messed-up situation. I’m not crazy. I still have a grasp on reality. Wasn’t that way for a while after my previous game, sure, but…” I turned around to see his silhouette in the darkness, and the dull, nearly fully decayed tritium of his gun’s lights pointing towards me. “You really just want to blow me up, Pete?” I asked him, while backpedaling as unnoticeably as possible. “What’s that going to fix for you, huh?” “You don’t get it. If it’s not me, he’ll send someone else, or do it himself. I’m just trying to give you a bit of fun beforehand.” “Or false hope. Or… maybe you’re just hoping I’ll vaporize you first.” He breathed deeply and choked on some air before replying, “I want the world to see , I just want to be believed . Doesn’t matter who wins tonight.” “How’s that going to work for you? Look around, man! We got so many vests between us that the lights can’t stay on. You think the cameras aren’t getting scrambled? Why don’t you get a few of these off of me. Hey, we go down to two, or even one vest each, and maybe they’ll actually pick something up. Then the survivor promises to leak it on YouTube, rack up a million views for ‘Killer Hospital Laser Tag Game – Real or Fake?’ That work for you?” “S-see? Now you’re getting it! That’s the kind of joke me and the gang would make! W-we should’ve grown up in the same neighborhood. You would’a liked the guys… Fit right in. But I can’t do that—’cause you’ll just cover up the only sensor. Not me, though. I wouldn’t cheat. Honest Nick… He never cheated, either… J-just liked playing games with his brother…” I was about to give up and leave the room. And then I looked at the computer’s tower near the monitor. He’d come looking for me again eventually, but while I did have a minute, I started working on a plan. The first step was to get out the screwdriver again and see how many vests I’d be able to pry off. I didn’t start with high hopes. Most of them were in better condition than the one with loose buckles. My plan was risky as hell, but as long as I could get pry off just one vest… “All right, man, you’re no fun,” he shouted a minute later. “I’m coming in, and we’ll just have a close-range gunfight. See who gets blown up first.” That was my cue. Pistol in hand, I looked out from the door and down the hall. “Okay, let’s get this over with,” I yelled back at him, wherever he was hiding. “What took you so long?” he replied from one of the rooms. “Fair, fair. I must’a looked at the floorplan for this place a hundred times while you were asleep. I should’a given you some time to prepare.” “ Pew… pew… ” I heard Peter say quietly. “ Not fair, Pete,” I shouted out, feigning confidence. “I can’t see your vest.” “Oh, right,” he said with a laugh. “Where’s the fun in that?” He stepped out into the hall and slowly approached as he continued shooting. I squeezed my trigger and returned fire, but kept my aim just slightly off so I didn’t risk hitting him. “You must have better aim than that!” he scoffed, and then opened his arms. “C’mon, I’ll give you a free shot!” “Stop calling me that! Just shoot me. I gotta know that you’re taking this seriously. C’mon, give me your best. I’m wide open.” I used the few seconds he was giving me to get closer to the door without the threat of getting hit, but I knew that his patience would run out. Fearing a retaliatory electric shock, or just a barrage of laser fire in my direction for not complying, I grasped my gun with both hands, exhaled, took aim, and fired. “Ah, I felt that. Good one!” Peter, still alive, replied—and then returned fire. “You giving up?” Peter shouted. “C’mon, it’s supposed to be a gunfight!” I snapped to my senses the instant I heard my uncovered vest emit a new sound. It was some kind of blaring, crackling warning alarm, but it wasn’t accompanied by a vibration or a shock from the vest—only a faint gasp from Peter. He recognized the sound, and it must’ve triggered a painful memory. All of this was enough to tell me that I was about to be vaporized. Or, rather and most likely, I’d simply turn into a bloody mess. Because considering the age of the batteries, there was no way they still packed that much of a punch. At least, I hoped so. It scorched my hand, but I tolerated the heat, and I was willing to risk a few broken bones, or at worst, sacrificing the whole thing. I was a righty, anyway. Stairs especially were still hard on my legs. At this point, I was at the brink of what I was physically capable of. If I ran around for much longer, I would probably collapse from exhaustion or chance a heart attack. I got up and watched as he fell onto his knees and gripped the screwdriver, but he couldn’t do much more than jostle it before letting out a whimper. “Why’d you do that…” he muttered. “Why couldn’t you just play fair…” He took out the remote to shock me again, but I slapped it right out of his hand. It hit the floor and slid away, disappearing under a lobby chair. He disagreed, and pulled at my leg, causing me to hit the floor. I landed painfully on my back and watched as he took out his laser gun and took aim at the sensor on my chest. I tried to kick it out of his hand, but my leg muscles were so weak that I barely batted away his arm. After that didn’t work, I rolled over and crawled towards one of the lobby chairs. Peter hit the sensors on my back a few times, but even at close range, he was too angry and in too much pain to get another critical shot off. Peter managed to stand up and started limping over, but he was struggling just to walk as he kept his gun on me. “It wasn’t supposed to be like this,” he said. “You were supposed to turn to ash, just like my brother. The world was supposed to see it happen.” I sighed and stood up so he could see me, though I kept my two front sensors covered. Behind him, two security guards were cautiously approaching. “You’re not giving me enough credit here,” I informed him. “I spent years running and hiding from a monster. In dreams, sure, but I guess it still counted for something.” “I’m… not a monster…” he murmured. “No, you’re not. But you need help.” “Get back!” Peter suddenly turned and shouted at the two security guards. Unable to tell if his gun was real or a toy, they backed off a bit. By this point, I was more worried about Peter’s well-being than my own. Then I saw that Boris came in with them, wearing a heavy jacket to combat the cold. To me, he might as well have teleported here, because I could’ve sworn he was still in Cuba. He looked at me, and then Peter, who looked back at them. The two officers assessed the situation quickly, and then saw the gun in Peter’s hand. Within seconds of arriving, their demeanors changed and they realized that this was more serious than they expected. “Easy, easy,” the younger of the two officers told Peter. “Drop the weapon.” “It can’t hurt you…” Peter grumbled back, who seemed unable to assess the danger he was now in—or just didn’t care. “You’re not wearing vests…” “What?” the older officer replied. “Hey, just put it on the floor. We don’t want to hurt you. Sir? Do you understand? Did you take anything tonight?” As they tried to deescalate things, Boris cautiously walked over to my side. I nodded, lying. My own laser gun was still at my side, but the cops’ attention wasn’t on me. I felt like I could only stand there helplessly, hoping that Peter would stand down and let the police take him into custody. “Tyler texted me,” Boris explained as he warmed up his hands. “Thought you were out of the country,” I replied, as if everything was back to normal all of a sudden and we could have a casual conversation. “My plane landed and my phone blew up with his texts. Called the police and rushed over straight from the airport. Jesus, so that’s really Peter… What the hell did he do to you?” he asked as he studied my vests. Don’t be stupid . “I just wanted them to see…” Peter murmured for the fifth or sixth time. The vest I got around his leg let out its warning beeps as its capacitors soaked in energy. Peter just stared at it without emotion. I don’t think the cops even really noticed. The moment after I scored my first critical hit of the night, I dropped my laser gun to the floor and kicked it under a chair. I figured that this was my last, only chance to get Boris his sought-after ’80s toy, and that I might as well try. Assuming it didn’t all get seized and disappear. Peter closed his eyes a moment before the battery exploded, maybe still expecting that it would kill him. Once they saw that Peter was no longer a threat, the four guys rushed to his aid while the receptionist got on the phone and summoned medical personnel. “The hell was that?” one of the officers exclaimed. “Was that a bomb?” his partner replied. \"Jesus, this one has more of them!\" I can remember clearly how he acted as he was carried out of the room. He was mostly mumbling incoherently, but I did pick up his disappointment. “Crazy night, man…” Boris said to me after I collapsed onto the nearest chair. “You have no idea.” The others became more cautious after my run-in and went quiet for a while, outside of some casual email conversations about other subject matter. When I changed rooms, I brought all of my get-well cards with me as a memento, and went through them properly, my mind more lucid than the first time I skimmed the handwritten well-wishes from family and friends. “Not this time. Just been thinking about something recently. It’s like… how much can we really trust our memories? We all think Peter got brainwashed, or I guess maybe they call it ‘reprogrammed’ now, so there’s proof right there of how pliable our minds can be. Tricked, manipulated. You know what I mean.” “Are we talking about Kiddie Land again?” “I still can’t make sense of the day we went out into the middle of nowhere, Ty.” “I can’t either, but the point I’m trying to make is… it’s scary, you know? To have your memories altered in a way where it feels like they’re modifying your own perception of the past. Literally rewriting your own history. You can’t actually change the past, but if you change how everyone believes it all happened, you might as well have invented a time machine.” “You don’t think…” “And you’re comparing that to being ‘reprogramed.’ I guess it really is.” “Would be an easy way to do it. Our new friend Pete might’ve been subjected to such horrors. Who knows what bits of truth he was allowed to keep and what he only thinks happened. Could be all his friends are still out there, looking for him, worried about the guy. Or maybe I’m just talking out of my ass, I dunno.” “Maybe we’ll hear from him again someday. But I think you might be onto something, once again.” “Or maybe I just have too much time to think. Take care of yourself, man. I don’t feel like there’s much more we can do or look for unless something springs up on its own. Maybe all this stuff really has dominated our lives long enough. It’ll keep pulling us back, because that’s what it does, but I’m not going to let it control me anymore. I’m gonna try and get back to appreciating the little things in a world that hasn’t experienced a nuclear winter. You should, too.” I personally liked the extra rest and a chance to slow down for a bit, even if it meant staying cooped up indoors. The gang still kept up on each other’s affairs, and we kept our discussions about relics and stories to a minimum. It was just nice to have someone to talk to, and it helped combat the sense of isolation just a bit. Weeks became months and then close to a year as life took a pause and the passage of time felt close to meaningless. “One day, I should be able to rejoin society, and I’m going to try and move on with my life. So many aspects of it were altered in ways I still don’t understand. There are details that the man changed for seemingly no reason. I’m not sure if I’ll ever escape the doubts I have about certain events. But that’s all in the past, and any memories I make from here on will be real. “Maybe you should move on, too, if you at all can. If there’s anything I got out of our late-night chat in a hospital lobby, it’s that we have similar personalities, and we can both get too obsessed and let questions and regrets linger too long. “I’m sorry for what I put you through. We may never meet in person again, but we both share in the fact that we’ve been given a second chance. I’m not going to waste it.”"}

As I peek through my drawn curtains I see that on the end of the street the man is still there, staring into my street. What he is doing I am unsure of but it is beginning to freak me out, people have walked right past him and not even given him a seconds notice. Why? Why am I the only one that has noticed the weird behavior of this man? It started this morning, I went into the kitchen to make some breakfast when I saw him through my kitchen window, standing there. That was five hours ago, five hours and not a single movement has been taken from my streets strange visitor. Perhaps I am being too irrational about this, maybe he is just… I don’t know, gazing at the street out of boredom. Maybe he will be gone later, I’ll check in in a couple of hours. Saturday 5:12 pm Sunday 10:36 am As I got up this morning I immediately went to check the window. I’m not sure whether he has been there all night or left when I went to sleep but I took a look and there he was in the same place, same position as yesterday. I immediately called the police, the other side of the line answered, “Hello?” I replied, “There is someone on my street that has been there for the past 24 hours.” “Ok, have you noticed anything strange about this individual?” “Apart from the fact that he hasn’t moved for 24 hours, no.” Monday 4:00 pm Tuesday 10:00 am Tuesday 2:49 pm Wednesday 7:59 pm Thursday 1:26 am I’m not imagining it this time, he is in my room, watching me. I don’t have the courage to turn on the lights yet, I need to get my story out first. I can hear his ghastly breathing among the silence, he smells like rotten garbage with a trace of rotting flesh. The smell alone is enough to make me want to vomit and the breathing is unlike anything I can describe. I believe my time is up, in a moment I am going to turn the lights on and take a good look at him. My story is out now and this is the last time you will be hearing from me."}

With a sigh, Little Timmy slowly closes the book, gets up and places it on his \"corner of books\", as his mother calls the pile at the corner of the room where Timmy puts his books. \"Yeah,\" Timmy responds, his soft voice trembling from the cold. \"Did you like it? I will take you to the bookshop to get another one for the holidays when the weather becomes better,\" Timmy's mother says, before she is struck by a coughing fit. It has been snowing heavily for days now and the two of them have been trapped in their home, while the old stove in the basement has broken down and there is no heating in the house. \"It's OK mom, I don't need one right now.\" Timmy, despite his young age, knows his mother doesn't have much money and doesn't want to put pressure on her. He jumps on the couch next to his mother and she strokes his hair affectionately as the two of them huddle together to fight off the growing cold. During the night... \"Having trouble sleeping, little one?\" a voice speaks up from the foot of the bed. With a swift move, a wooden nutcracker toy soldier climbs onto the bed and sits on Little Timmy's leg. Little Timmy peeks out from under the blanket. \"Hi Alexandre,\" the boy says with a frail voice. Little Timmy nods in agreement. \"She is having a rough night, isn't she?\" Alexandre pauses for a second. \"But I heard you just finished your book! How was it?\" \"It was good.\" \"I want to help too!\" Little Timmy says, his voice stronger. Morning comes... Little Timmy spends the day taking care of his mother. He cleans around the house, cooks and caters to her needs. Her condition has worsened during the night. She is feverish and can't stop coughing. She is stuck to her bed for the whole day. To keep her warm, Timmy gave her his blanket, no matter how she refused. Still, the house is terribly cold and the stove remains broken. Night falls again... Little Timmy groggily opens his eyes. The moustachioed face of the soldier greets him. \"Sorry to wake you up, but I think I found what the problem with the stove is. The basement is covered in snow!\" \"In snow? H-how?\" Timmy's timid voice speaks out. \"There is snow everywhere! On the floor, the shelves, everywhere I say!\" \"H-how is this pos-\" Timmy's sentence is interrupted by heavy coughing from his mother's room. Alexandre looks at Little Timmy stoically. Suddenly, the sound of a door slamming shut echoes across the house. Little Timmy gasps. \"Must have been the wind...\" Alexandre says. The footsteps abruptly stop. The door to the mother's room creaks open. The footsteps resume. Someone has entered the room. The door to the mother's room closes shut. Timmy starts sobbing lightly. Alexandre frantically jumps around the room, trying to find the key. Then, from the mother's room, a loud moan. \"Mommy!\" Timmy cries. Alexandre is livid, eyes darting around and mind racing for a way out. The moans get louder and louder, until they suddenly stop, replaced by rhythmic wheezing. Alexandre moves a stool under the handle, climbs on and jams his metal sword in the lock and frantically moves it around. The door clicks open and the toy soldier jumps out, his wooden boots clacking across the cold floor. He runs to the mother's room, but as he reaches the door, it swings open and a wild gust of wind blows into the hallway, lifting Alexandre and slamming him against the wall. Then, an eerie silence falls upon the house. Only the muffled crying of Little Timmy and the heavy breathing of the mother disturb the stillness of the cold night. The weak morning sunrays break through the dark clouds... \"Mommy. Mommy, please wake up,\" Little Timmy begs his mother. She has grown deathly pale and she is very cold. She is breathing with difficulty and she is shaking. \"I warmed you some milk, please drink it, it will do you good.\" But she does not respond, lost deep into feverish dreams. Little Timmy places the glass of milk on the nightstand and turns to leave. He has a lot of housework to do. During the day though, he takes great care to stay away from the basement door. The moon shines brightly in the sky... \"I gathered some wood and dry branches, I will light the old stove and we will be warm again.\" \"Wh-what about the thing?\" \"Don't be scared Little Timmy, Alexandre will take care of it!\" the toy soldier says with a warm smile. \"Anyway, I see you started writing the story you were telling me about,\" he says pointing at the notebook by the nightstand. \"How is it going? This must be fun!\" \"It's great, I'm at the part where Jack sneaks into the Mouse King's castle to save Eliza.\" \"He is very brave. But he is not as brave as his guardian...\" Little Timmy says, his gaze wandering off in the distance. An hour has passed and Alexandre still hasn't returned, nor is the stove lit. Little Timmy is growing more anxious by the minute. He fears the worst. Thinking of what Alexandre would do for him, he decides to go to the basement. With trembling hands he opens the door. His mother is fast asleep. Little Timmy covers her exposed to the cold body with her blankets and starts the long walk towards the basement. Time seems to have stopped while Timmy makes his way to the basement door. The incessant wind has ceased blowing and the house is plunged into complete silence. He takes a deep breath and with shaking hands reaches for the doorknob. The old door opens, the rusty hinges groaning under the weight of the metal door. The cold breath of the darkness below hits Little Timmy in the face. For a moment his will falters, but he steels himself and pushes his legs down the slippery stairs, the open, dark mouth of the basement below staring back into his little heart. Timidly, Little Timmy takes a step forward. As soon as his foot lands, a gust of wind blows from the back of the basement, swirling snow and stuff around. Timmy covers himself as best as he can. When the ruckus stops, a tall, white silhouette stands in the middle of the room. The man-like creature is crouched over, its thin torso almost floating on its lean limbs. Its skin has a parch like texture and breaks up here and there. The creature sniffs the air and turns towards Timmy. Its black eyes meet with his as the creature starts to move towards Timmy, who can only watch paralyzed. \"Over here!\" Alexandre's voice echoes in the basement, pulling Timmy out of his trance. Little Timmy follows the voice and finds the toy soldier hiding under a shelf, a pile of wood by his side. He is in a very dire state, his torso is cracked, wooden splinters spurting out from his body, and his right leg is severed from the knee down. To stand up, he is using a branch as a crutch. \"We don't have much time. You need to go and put the wood into the stove. That will drive the creature away and heat the house! I will distract him! Quickly!\" Alexandre starts hopping to the other side of the room while Little Timmy grabs the wood and branches and sneaks his way to the stove. \"Over here, you big snowflake!\" Alexandre shouts at the creature, which turns and gallops toward him, its bony spine arched back and its sharp claws clicking on the floor. Little Timmy is halfway to the stove, but he slips and the branches scatter across the floor with a loud noise. The creature stops in its tracks and turns towards the boy. It glances at the pile of wood on the floor and then the stove. With a gritty laugh it grabs the wood, which dissolves under its touch. It then moves closer to Timmy, who backs away as fast as he can. Alexandre sprints as fast as his one leg allows and gets between the creature and Timmy. \"For Little Timmy, be strong for Little Timmy,\" he whispers under his breath. With that, Alexandre pushes himself into the old stove, which flares up in powerful red flames. A blinding white light shoots out and the wave of heat that follows shakes the foundations of the whole room. First the stalactites quickly melt off and the snow evaporates into mist. Then the wave engulfs the creature, its white skin catching fire like old parchment. It lets out a scream of agony, flames shooting out from its body. A big hole of fire opens up in its chest as it falls to its knees. It looks at its hands as they are burned off its body, shattering and evaporating upon hitting the floor. The creature, finally, vaporizes into a dark smoke. Only Little Timmy now stands in the basement. In his warm, star-lit room... Little Timmy finishes writing his story. He gets up from his desk and walks towards his toys chest. He carefully places the notebook on the wooden box. \"... with the Mouse King defeated, Jack and Eliza lived happily ever after, with Alex always watching them from above, smiling warmly. Jack's ever-loving guardian."}

This is probably not the place for penning down what is happening. But I need to put it somewhere. I feel....unsafe. Three times in such a short period of time cannot be a coincidence. Forgive me if you don't find this creepy, I am just doing this because I feel the need to post this somewhere. At least someone will know what's going on. It is something concrete. I live with my mother and two elder sisters. That day, both my sisters were visiting my cousins. Mom was asleep in her room. It was like any other night and I hit the bed at 2 am (I am a late sleeper). I cowered in my bedsheets the whole night and kept chanting the 'Hanuman Chalisa' (A prayer to a Hindu God for driving demons away). I was not fatigued, was suitably rested everyday and was in a peaceful state of mind. Also, I was sleeping belly down and no sleep paralysis instances have been recorded in that position. This thing happened out of nowhere. I started sweating profusely which I skipped mentioning above. It will sound cliched but I can tell you that the man I saw was there, it was physical and I was most definitely not hallucinating. I thought that all the neighbours would be up because of the commotion. The shrieking stopped just as I was about to reach the door and I heard the doors of the car being banged shut. I went to the balcony, it was quiet as fuck. I could not believe my eyes. It was very peaceful in the neighbourhoood and not a single person could be seen. I never heard the car drive away. And not a single person got up because of the loud shrieks? I tried brushing this off as a fragment of my imagination but I could not. It was all too real. I just went back to my room and slept. 'GO AWAY,' I said aloud. 'Please go away, you are not welcome here.' I opened my eyes and again peered at the door. This time there was no one there but the door was still ajar. This was the last experience. Nothing has happened this past week. I will keep you posted if anything else happens. Will also let you guys know if everything is alright till the end of the month."}

I have been called a demon, a ghost, a poltergeist, a spirit and even the boogeyman. However, I have no memory from before this incorporeal existence to confirm or deny any such names. I have no eyes yet I can see, I have no ears yet I can hear. I do not have a body, I have no shape. If I strain my will I can mimic a human's. If I will it I can move objects with my thoughts. However, both take a great toll on me and grow more and more difficult as the number of witnesses increases. I do not know what I am, but I know am very old. The Grahams lived a rather uneventful life. I watched them for years go about their dull lives. I kept my distance, stayed unattached. They grew older and eventually left. They moved out west for a better job. This led to the Youngs moving in. A modern family for a more modern age. Jane and Hank were the parents, both worked for a living. Elizabeth was their daughter, the kind of girl that would put posters of then-popular boy bands on her room walls. James was the youngest and most fascinating in the family. James was broken and everyone else in the family ignored it. He was thirteen when I first met him. As I observed him, he observed others much the same way. He would spend hours alone and the rest of his family seemed happy to be away from him. His room was his sanctuary; a place he could be his true self. He changed when he left his room, he faked normalcy. Any breach of his sanctuary caused him to turn violent. The first time I saw this was when he nearly broke his older sister's arm slamming it in the door. So his family avoided trying to break into his world."}

Sometime later, I was removed from the box and unceremoniously thrown on top of a rocking chair. I landed hard against it, filling my body with blunt pain. The room clearly belonged to the young girl. It was decorated with pink colors, stuffed animals, and all things girly. However, despite the poor décor, I saw an opportunity to try to communicate, holding on to some slim hope that she'd notice me, or the me that was trapped in this body. Perhaps she did notice something; later that night, she stared at me. However, my hopes died as she simply said “creepy,” and threw a pillow on top of me as she turned off the lights for the night. As time passed, I understood that there were rules to my condition. I could move only with great willpower, and only when no one was watching. It started with only an inch or so, but grew the more I practiced. With this new hope, I redoubled my efforts to try to seek help. It was one night that I managed to finally remove myself from the rocking chair. I dropped with a thump to the floor. The impact hurt, but I deemed it worth the pain. I sat facing the door to the room. Alice would notice me, and she could help me if she know I was alive."}
{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Happy_Reality", "title": "A Happy Reality", "author": "the way she", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Weird"], "content": "“Thank you for keeping it safe for two whole days!” the woman says chipperly. “There must have been a lot of obstacles on the way.” She is petite, and absolutely brilliantly happy. Her eyes glimmer in the sunlight shining through the branches of the tree in her yard. By the way she’s holding onto the porcelain doll I just delivered to her, I know it’s an important thing. Emotionally, at least. That knowledge amplifies the great joy of bringing it safely to her. “Do you want a cookie?” she asks when I say I have to go. “I just baked a fresh batch. Double chocochip.” I think for a minute and then nod. “I’d love one, thank you, ma’am.” Today is a sunny, warm day of late summer - perfect weather for a cookie or two. After a minute or two without an answer, I ring the doorbell again, and politely ask, “Anyone home? Hello?” I hear a cough from somewhere inside the house. Then the muffled rattling of a chair, a door bursting open like someone shoves it off hinge, and then a grunt and a thud. “Do you need help?” I ask louder. “Sir? Ma’am?” “Open the door,” someone says faintly. I open the door. There is a person on the floor, bundled in a thick woolen blanket. Their hands are braced in front of them, trembling slightly the way very old people do, and yet from the look of their skin and (albeit thinning) black hair, they can’t be older than mid-thirty. The ankle protruding from under the blanket seems to be sprained. The person looks up at me with wide, tired eyes. “Help me up,” they say, always out of breath. “You’re smiling,” the person croaks. “Brightly.” “I find it appropriate to show my happiness,” I reply. They bark out a breathy laugh. “Happiness!” “I bring you the CD one of your friends sent four days ago,” I tell them, “a… Joanna Bellum?” They nod. “A Top 100 R&B 2015 CD. It’s in perfect condition.” I beam at the excellence with which we’ve carried out our work. The person doesn’t comment anything on that fact. Just a grunt and a sigh, “Now it arrives.” I don’t know how to react to that. I’ve never met that way of expressing oneself before. I think that, and then tell myself, well, never miss a chance to learn more! The person looks at me funny through their messy fringes; there is a very, very strange emotion in those eyes. Their jaw goes rigid, as if they’re chewing on something tough, and their fists ball up in the bundle of blanket in their lap. The intense stare goes on for a minute, but then they deflate, and another sigh escapes their mouth, followed by a string of coughs. “Fuck, it hurts,” they mumble, then speak up a bit through ragged breaths, “and sorry. This is not your fault. None of this is your fault.” This person is very bizarre. My mind blanks out on a word they say. It’s hard to catch it back. “Sorry?” I ask as politely as I can. “Can I do anything for you, uh--” I bring Kate a cup of tap water from the sink in the kitchen, noticing on the way a burnt pan and some crushed eggs on the ground. She must be learning how to cook. “You are doing an excellent job, Kate,” I encourage her when I come back into the living room with the cup of water. Encouragement is important. I really, really don’t know what to do. “Uh, Kate?” I try to ask again. “Do you need help?” Kate almost blows up between wrenching coughs. She throws expletives at me, puts the cup down onto the wooden table in front of her and makes the glass crack a bit. “Fuck you!” She screams hoarsely with her definitely scratched throat. “Fuck you and your help! You come too late, fucker, and now you dare ask me! Swear to God I will– right here– I’ll–” She flops back down and tries to control her breath - seems like she has great difficulty breathing. More grunting before she deflates again, this time without an apology. Recognising the look of confusion in my eyes, Kate sits up a bit and laughs without any joy (how is that possible?). “You’re really happy, aren’t you,” she says with false kindness. “Yes,” I hesitate a bit before answering, “yes, I’m happy.” My mind blanks out on me again. I just stare at Kate, feeling like she’s speaking an unknown language. She laughs a trembling hush. Kate laughs again. She seems very… tired. On the outside, at least. I think for a bit, and only come up with ‘not happy’. Clearly not the answer she’s waiting for. ‘Confused’ and ‘tired’ don’t cut it either. Kate looks even… less happy… than she did earlier. She looks like a pair of soggy socks. She reaches for the cup of water but can’t bring her hands up; I pick it up and help her take another sip. This time she coughs a bit less. Curiosity gets the better of me after an inner debate. “What job?” I ask Kate. She turns to look at me with apparent surprise on her haggard face. “Are you asking?” “Am I not supposed to?” Her words make me hesitate again, but she chokes out a laugh like this is her name on a million dollar lottery ticket. “No,” she says. “No. Do you want the full story?” There is a ‘please’ somewhere in there. I look at Kate’s bright, tired eyes, and nod. She smiles, for the first time with true feelings. “Okay. Sit down, please. Have a drink– eat something– don’t, don’t leave, please. Hear me out. It’s fucked up and sounds so stupid, but it’s true. I swear to god it’s true. Please believe me.” I don’t know what else to do other than sit down and nod. That’s enough to please Kate, apparently. Her smile widens a bit. “So you don’t know what the opposite of ‘happiness’ is,” she starts her story immediately. “What do you feel when you don’t feel happy?” I stare at her for a minute. I am not one to usually consider my emotions, but I do know that there’s nothing without happiness. Everyone is happy. If there isn’t that, there’ll only be just… “Emptiness.” I say. “I don’t think there should be anything outside that? No one is not a little bit happy.” “Please explain,” I am a bit overwhelmed, but also intrigued. A feeling of completely no happiness? How is that even possible? Kate sits up a bit straighter. “How do you feel when you’re sick?” “I feel… woozy. And sleepy.” “When someone else sustains an injury?” “If they’re fine with it then I’m also fine with it.” “When a pet dies?” “They don’t know anything. They’re quiet, and then gone. I am happy that they’re as free as that.” “When you’re in an accident?” “If I inconvenience someone, or vice versa, then we work it out together; if that’s not the case, then nothing’s the matter.” Kate looks at me, seemingly forgets to even breathe. She looks… lost. Like she doesn’t have an answer for this. I try to stand up. “Well, if I can’t help you with this–” “No!” She shouts with all her might, which is not very much, but she gets my attention. “No, please.” Her hand’s tugging weakly on my sleeve. “Please hear me out. There are other things than happiness. It’s real. They’re real.” “I’m sorry that I cannot help you prove that,” I say politely, “but I think someone else can. I can try to ask around–” “No one else can,” she cuts me off mid-sentence. There are tears in her eye. They just make the rest of her eyes look even drier. “I just– I need to get the story out.” She grunts, and takes her hand back to tear at her shoulder, nails biting into flesh. I think the action helps ground her. “I can’t take this anymore. It’s too much. Can’t even tell up from down. Can’t even see straight. What day is it?” I try to give her a good answer. “I think you can call 911–” “What day is it?” she hisses through her gritted teeth. “Wednesday. 22nd.” Tears well up in Kate’s eyes. She scratches her shoulder, her face scrunches up even further. Her mouth gapes open in a strange expression. “It’s only three days. God, only three days. I can’t do this anymore.” “Ma’am,” I say. “Katherine.” “Only three days!” She screeches between hiccups, her voice more and more faint. Her shoulder spots a new bruise; she holds it stiffly while crying. Not of joy. This isn’t like joy at all. “Three days since that fucking dream. Those cloaked men. Figures. I can’t even remember clearly.” She coughs; there’s blood on the blanket now. Her wrist is as stiff as her shoulder. “They bait me with my girl. They know she’s in the hospital. They know I’m weak. Fuck, what kind of human am I?” “A good one, I suppose?” I try to say something helpful. She laughs raggedly. “Damn right, a good human! An excellent mother, who can’t even pay for her little girl’s surgeries!” Her breaths come too fast now. “So they dangle her last days in front of me, they say if I can shoulder this then my girl’s gonna be happy, the whole damn world’s gonna be happy, and guess what! They’re right!” She tries to inhale through her nose, and triggers another chain of coughs. I don’t know what to do. The coughs and the injuries seem to affect her greatly, and not in a way I can understand. “What did you agree to do?” I ask her. “Bear the whole world’s pain.” She grunts through strong emotions. Lets out a quiet cry when her left eye looks suddenly a lot glassier. “Take whatever is the opposite of happiness, dump it on me. Yours! My daughter’s! This whole damn country’s! The world’s!” She is tearing at her own shoulder. “Fuck! This hurts so fucking much. I can’t– can’t do it. I was a dumb, arrogant bitch. My little girl died, and this pain’s eating at me, and I am not allowed to let it end! It just can’t!” I try again. “How can I help you?” After a while, I say with care, “I’m sorry that I ca–” And then Kate looks at me. Her wide, bloodshot eyes are wild and… I can’t describe them. The emotion behind them is strong. It pushes me to stand up and take a step back. It grates on some unknown parts of my mind, how great the pressure from that gaze is. “Get the fuck out!” Kate hollers, her voice breaking, and I comply even though the confusion and curiosity still urges me to stay. From outside the door, I can hear loud, broken sobs. A neighbour peers out from behind the white fence. “What happened?” he asks. I shrug. “I don’t really know. Ms. Katherine says a lot of strange things.” “She really needs help,” he says. “I can’t help her though.” “Someone will be able to,” I reply, and he nods and goes back to whatever he was doing. I don’t see the car coming straight at me; it takes a sharp turn when we see each other, and crashes into a lightpole. I exit the van and hurry to its front door. The driver of the car is conscious, but his ribcage is bashed in. He staggers out of his seat. He looks into the back seat, where his little baby lays with unseeing eyes and a large bruise on its temple. “Do you need help?” I ask him. He looks back at me and offers a warm smile. “No, no, don’t inconvenience yourself. I can go to the hospital from here.” I look at his lopsided torso and his genuine smile, and say, “If that pleases you. Would you at least accept a cookie? Double chocochip, still fresh.” He takes a cookie and then makes his way to the hospital in the opposite direction. I return to my van and continue my job. It stays sunny until late afternoon. Today’s been a beautiful day indeed."}

Two weeks later, there was a sound. There was a humming. It came from that place on the carpet, the spot near the corner. His spot. I’m getting concerned. I guess I was a bit distracted before, but my mind is clear now. They’re gone, and I am frankly growing more concerned by the minute. Today it has appendages. I am not sure if they existed before, but now they most certainly do. It has two, with one on either side, and it crawls haphazardly along like some sort of horrid lopsided insect. It tried to follow me out through the door, but I kicked it and it did not try any longer. It thumps around as I try to sleep, dragging its body everywhere and leaving residue all over the house. It now has four appendages and is beginning to form a skull-like dome under its pulsing skin. It has a mouth, a crooked little mouth, and I am afraid it will begin to make sounds at me. Three of the appendages are longer than the fourth, so it mostly wobbles around in crooked little circles. It is getting bigger, and it never stops changing. I was hoping it would stay and become some sort of indiscernible monster, but now I am sure that it is becoming a person, or at the very least something similar. I would like to kill it. I wonder if I could. It sits at the top of the stairs, waiting for me, smiling down at me with crooked reflective eyes and a small mouth full of small black teeth. My bedroom is upstairs. I am afraid to go up. It also has hands and feet now; the nubs gave way to small, slender fingers and toes. It is beginning to walk and climb about, and there are small white hand prints smudged on all of the doorknobs. I think at this point towels will do me no good. It can open doors. I’m sure of it now. It’s androgynous in anatomy, but for him I think it male. It still smiles at me and stares, but says nothing. A small mercy. I stared at the thing and then tossed the old book to the carpet. To think; to only have to deal with a beating beneath the floorboards! This thing mocked me and tormented me and lived and breathed and watched. It looked at the book for a moment, then curled up in the corner and stared at me, large uneven eyes with skin pulled back around. It stared at me and smiled with its little teeth. The thing has started polluting my food or hiding it or both, and I found that shampoo burns my scalp and razors jut from the pages of my books. No longer content to mull around and lurk in corners, it is now actively making my life miserable. If I killed it, would the authorities come back and blame me for killing a person, I wondered? I wondered. I wondered if it would try to snake a hand through the hole in the screen and reach for me. Last night I sat on the couch flipping channels, desperate for any distraction or escape. The phone was next to me, but I was too afraid to call anyone for help, lest what happened before be found out. It must be said, though, that the pressure was becoming unbearable. It sat in his corner again, sat in a sphinx-like position despite looking so human now, and just as I hit the one channel with static for the umpteenth time the thing in the corner began to whisper. I ignored it and changed the channel, hoping it would shut up. Its whispering merely grew in speed and intensity, and while it did not move, its eyes reflected the television screen and widened and its small chest heaved as it rattled off. I turned up the volume and began flipping rapidly, infomercial then sports channel then a cartoon, then suddenly his face was on the screen, tongue lolling out and blue face gasping for air and mercy and the thing was in front of me and in front of the television, facing me, gibbering and staring and I screamed over it and the television and the room went dark This is too much, and I understand now the extent of blind terror the idea of certain death instinctively brings about in people. I have known the thrill of killing and the fear of being caught, but neither the idea of retribution nor of my life itself ending were ever real to me. The mere thought of this thing, however, drives a black and bleak and cold and nearly unbearable fear to my core, let alone the feeling that I get when I feel it mulling about my room at night or when I awake to find small bruises, cuts, and white chalky smudges on my person. I want to kill it, but I don’t know what would happen if I tried. I don’t know what to do. I’ll say it here. Maybe it will help. It has been a while, but I murdered him. It’s all clean, but I did it. He looked at me and looked at me and looked at me and would not stop. I should have known he would never stop. I knocked him down and strangled him until his throat collapsed under my thumbs and I dumped the body somewhere far away. The humming and the warmth all over and I can see its reflection in my computer monitor I wonder what it would depend on if it killed me or if someone else did. Maybe I will do it. I have a pistol in a box in my bedroom closet, and if I were to fling the thing from its watching place down the stairs it would give me enough time to run and grab the gun. I just wouldn’t be sure who to use it on. Maybe I’m a fool. Maybe it knows everything. Regardless, it’s in my dreams and my brain and every waking moment and I am determined to end it. I found my solution. I purchased a shotgun. If we’re both within range when I pull the trigger, it should do the trick. Wish me luck. Why didn’t I die Why didn’t it die I don’t understand I cleaned the carpet after before but now it’s soaked with blood I bled like a person and the thing bled black and it’s all everywhere and I haven’t looked in the mirror but I blasted half of its skull off and there are bits of red and blue flesh everywhere and it’s still looking at me leering at me smiling at me spurting and bleeding at me the keyboard is covered in my blood and I don’t know how long I can keep this up I only have one idea left I think I am going to go I’ll keep you updated as we learn more, of course. It’s all very strange. Thanks for the help. Yours Truly, —– —– —— Police Department"}

Its pale white face shook me deeply, standing out entirely on its own from the large black cloak it wore. “What do you say…?” “T-t-t…” was all I could muster before running from the house. A pair of arms interrupted my escape, quickly grabbing my fairy princess dress and hoisting me upwards. My heart started to race rapidly as I heard footsteps clicking along the pathway behind me. I thrust my eyes into my uncle’s shoulder, trying to hide from the beast, but when he told me to look, I was turned around to meet it once more. My cries echoed through the neighbourhood once again as the monster laughed, its pearly white fangs matching perfectly with its face. “Oh, I’m sorry dear-y. Here, have some extra for being such a brave girl.” The monster then stretched out the opening of my bag and dumped in two big chocolate bars and a bag of chips. “What do you say, Jackie?” Uncle Hugh asked. “Th-th-thank, you…” I mumbled before hiding my face again. I knew the candy was free, but having to approach these terrifying monsters to get it was just too much.

{"url": "https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Guest_to_Dinner", "title": "A Guest to Dinner", "author": "Unknown", "publication_date": null, "tags": ["Weird"], "content": "“Excuse me sir, but are you quite alright?” the stranger asked in a deep, raspy voice that gave the homeless man chills despite the kind tone in his voice. The homeless man nodded to his question. “You can’t speak?” “No matter, I was going to invite you to dinner whether or not you were capable of all five of your senses,” the tall man said, causing the homeless man to look at him in a confused gaze. “Now, would you like to come have dinner with me? My caretaker is nearly finished making my dinner.” The tall man looked at his gold pocket watch to make sure. The homeless man was practically in tears by his man’s kindness. Sure, at first he was hesitant by his intimidating voice and appearance, but the tall man was inviting a homeless man to dinner, that’s the definition of a saint. “My name is Lazarus by the way, Lazarus Thorne,” the tall man said, properly introducing himself. “I would love to know your name but I guess that’s not going to happen, unless you could write it on a piece of paper. You can write, yes?” The homeless man nodded yes to his question. “It’ll be quite nice to have a guest to dinner; I can get pretty lonely at times. I mean Minnie, my caretaker is always around and she makes for fantastic company don’t get me wrong, but she’s very quiet; Not very good at conversations at all really,” Lazarus explained, making the homeless man a bit confused. Lazarus seemed to be a man that liked to talk, but being a mute, the bum really wouldn’t be a very articulate speaker either. Finally the duo got to Lazarus’s house. It was a huge, Victorian gothic styled home. A huge outcry from the “ordinary” houses that occupied the rest of the neighborhood, with a large black fence covered in brambles. However, the garden was the exact opposite; very elaborate and well-kept with flowers of all different types and colors. The homeless man thought that this Lazarus person must have been filthy rich to afford it. “Don’t worry about opposing, I promise there will be more than plenty to eat, Minnie does tend to go overboard with the cooking. Sometimes I wonder if she’s trying to fatten me up or something Hahahaha! Ah, another reason why I should have more guests to dinner.” After his booming laughter, Lazarus pulled out a key from his pocket and unlocked the door. The two went in and the homeless man’s jaw nearly dropped to the floor. Lazarus couldn’t help but chuckle at the homeless man’s hungry gaze. “Ah, Minnie there you are!” Lazarus exclaimed with joy. “My guest and I were just speaking about you.” After placing the final dish in front of Lazarus, The Asian caretaker said nothing as she gazed at the dwarfish man sitting across the stretched table. Her wide icy eyes still not blinking. This terrified the homeless man, he expected her to jump at him at any moment. “Well, don’t be rude Minnie,” Lazarus said as he took a sip of cherry wine from his glass. Minnie complied in an almost robotic way, bowing in a respectful manner to the homeless man and walked in her slow and stiff matter to the center of the table, staring off into space and waiting for another order. “I’m a man who is in love with the world,” Lazarus said out of nowhere, causing the homeless man to cough. He looked at the rich man with a confused look. “On my journeys, I’ve met and done yoga with Monks in China, participated in the glorious Bon festivals in Japan; I’ve joined bongo circles in Jamaica and did the Kalinka with Russian folk dancers!” Lazarus said with great enthusiasm. The homeless man listened as he ate. “Every place I go, I bring something back home with me, whether it’s something physical or knowledge about that place, or its people and what they taught me. I remember every place I’ve been to, the name of every town and city I’ve visited. I even know how to speak ten different languages and to think, I would’ve never become the cultured man I am today if it wasn’t for my fortune…” Lazarus stopped as he looked fondly at Minnie as she reentered the dining room. “I also would’ve never met Minnie.” The homeless man stopped eating and gave Lazarus his full attention. Lazarus coughed to clear his throat. “Now, I don’t necessarily believe in that sort of thing, but what he taught me was fascinating in theory,” Lazarus said as he poured himself another glass of wine. Lazarus explained as he looked back at the smiling grey woman. “Minnie, this is truly fantastic you really outdid yourself this time!” Lazarus praised his lover and caretaker as he dug into the plush dessert. “Minnie, be a dear and give our guest a slice, he simply cannot miss out on this!” “My word, are you quite alright my friend?” Lazarus said with concern. The homeless man raised his hand in a defensive stance as he tried to keep his composure. The bum tried to go back to eating the cake but started to gag. The smell was the most awful thing he’s ever picked up and he was also, unfortunately very familiar to it as well. It was none other than… The stench of death. “I’m… awfully sorry but… It’s getting rather late and I think it’s the best that you leave now,” Lazarus said with almost no emotion in his tone. The bum, still shaking from terror and sickness, ran out of the dining room and left with a loud slam of the front door. “Goodbye,” Lazarus said with a disappointed tone in his voice. The next day, Lazarus was up at six thirty in the morning, sitting in a large felted chair located in his African inspired living room, yawning from his well-deserved slumber. Minnie walked up to him with a tray containing his breakfast. Two slices of lightly buttered toast, Italian sausage filled with spices and fennel, and a teapot containing hot, freshly prepared tea. Lazarus went straight for the tea. He poured some into the teacup accompanying it and generously sipped it. “Thank you very much Minnie, you make the best Russian milk tea.” “Oh and Minnie,” Lazarus spoke up, causing Minnie to stop at the entrance of the living room. “Don’t feel as if you scared away my guest, it was very rude of him to react the way he did.” Lazarus said with a serious tone in his deep voice. “One should never be so rude to bring up a women’s smell, especially not in the matter he did, homeless or not!” Lazarus yelled with an annoyed tone. He got up from his chair, walked up and grabbed the zombie of a woman by her shoulders. “I thought that a man in his position wouldn’t dare judge you or me,” Lazarus spoke, comforting the unblinking corpse. “You are a glorious specimen Minnie, you are in every sense of the word, the perfect woman and a great person, that is why I brought you back after that horrific accident… and I promise that I will try to find better company to join us for dinner and conversation. People that won’t judge you!” Lazarus said as he pulled her into a hug. Minnie put her cold arms around him and slowly opened her smiling mouth uttering a deep, inhuman groan. “I love you too,” said Lazarus."}

We sat in a row of cubicles in our own small room. Our job was to edit cartoon knock-offs of popular children’s characters, typically Spiderman, Elsa, Spongebob, My Little Pony, etc. We worked on one or two videos per week, and basically we just created cartoon objects and settings. The work was surprisingly simple. There was very little real “animation” required. The job paid so much that I hardly paid attention to how strange it was. The company divided our labor in such a way that none of us animators ever saw a video in its entirety. We each worked on a few seconds of it, and often, the project would be taken away from us and transferred to another department before we were finished. The rules were odd. The animators and I were not allowed to speak to each other under any circumstance. We were not permitted to exchange names or introduce ourselves. Speaking, or looking at another person’s computer, was a terminatable offense. No two people were allowed in the break room at the same time, and no cell phones were permitted inside the building. Ever. More than $20/hour? I guess my memory is for sale, because I quickly forgot about the video. As far as I could tell, the video was not acted. What I saw was a real “medical” procedure, and real terror. Horrified, I emailed my boss, demanding an explanation. I received none after about an hour (normally he replies within minutes or even seconds), so I left my cubicle and stormed down the hall to knock on his office door. The conference room was dark, but I could see about fifteen men sitting inside at the far end of the wall. Most of them were dressed nicer than me, so I knew that they were senior employees who worked upstairs. A video played on a large screen at the other end of the room, and even though I couldn’t see it from my angle, I recognized the sounds. They were watching the same horrific video I’d seen an hour before. Some of the employees smoked cigarettes, like they were at a fucking gentleman’s club. Perhaps strangest of all, a conference phone sat in front of them, and a loud voice came through the speaker, talking in Russian. One of the men in the room occasionally replied in Russian. But weird shit continued happening, and it got worse and worse. I was confused and disturbed by this video, but it wasn’t until YouTube’s stupid Autoplay feature cycled to another “recommended video” that I really freaked out. Another video played, then another, and another, all products of my company, some of which I’d worked on. Every video featured recognizable children’s characters from Disney and Marvel and other big brands, but something weird – or violent – or sexual – took place in them. It wasn’t until I returned home and started digging around on YouTube that the true scope of these fucked up videos came to light. I found several channels with child-oriented names like “Silly Hero Fun” (not a real name, mods), all of which produce videos exactly like the ones I'd worked on. They all specifically target children using familiar characters, and they all link to more legitimate cartoons via the “recommended videos” algorithm. The themes I’ve identified are as follows: -The fact that violence and sex are such recurrent themes tells me that the creators want to normalize them. They want kids to be desensitized to sex and violence. Maybe even curious about them. In short, these videos are designed to groom children, and to satisfy perverts. Worse, a man actually tried to pick Katie up from kindergarten by claiming he was me. He gave the office my full name and told them he was her uncle, here to pick Katie up for a doctor’s appointment. When the receptionist said she was going to call Katie’s parents for verification, the man took off running. He didn’t even get into a car. He ran out of the parking lot. \"A Group Of People Are Targeting Kids On Youtube\" - Written by Felix Blackwell Narration by Mr. Creeps The YouTube Elsagate Conspiracy!

I left what used to be the inn I was visiting. Now, it looked more like... a cave? I wasn't entirely aware of what was going on. It was as though my mind was only focused on finding the source of the voice. After walking through an odd environment for what seemed like days, I came across a small house. For some reason, I knew what I was looking for was there. So I decided to enter. When I did, I heard this: \"It's about time.\" They treated me with the woman's finest cooking. However, I was uncomfortable throughout the whole meal. I stared at the husband the whole time. Luckily, it- he- didn't seem to notice. After dinner, the wife directed me to a bedroom. Filled with the food, and the shame of staring at her husband, I quickly entered. When I did, the wife told me something. \"If you wish to be my future husband, kill my present one. I have no use for him.\" With a combination of the hatred to the man and love for the woman, I listened. I waited until the creature was asleep, then I stabbed it. I was then greeted by the woman. \"I welcome you into my life,\" she said. At that point, I began to transform. I was changing into the very thing I'd killed. I met my girlfriend on that day.

You always have been. Watching you grow from boy to man to father has been my greatest point of pride, and throughout it all, I knew you always loved me. Where so many people grow to resent and turn away from their parents, I have always thanked God that our bond has held strong. My thoughts were on the day’s events and on Jessica as I lay in bed. I remember slipping in and out of a dreamlike state as the entire world lay quiet around me. That’s why I didn’t react at first when a figure stepped into my doorway. The motion of its arrival drew my eyes, and for a while I simply stared. There are no words that can accurately convey how I felt to see the face that peered down at me, Daniel. No description I give here can do it justice, I’m sure. Where its eyes should be were two patches of inky blackness that seemed fluid in nature. They were constantly in flux, changing their shape and size, almost like jellyfish. Its nose was little more than two stretched holes beneath an almost imperceptible bony point. The mouth was possibly the strangest of all. Its jaw hung open and rested against its chest. Inside were rows of flat teeth like a horse’s. The creature moved its lower mandible back and forth in an unnatural, almost taunting way. I was utterly paralyzed with fear. A cold sweat broke out over my entire body. I tensed, waiting for something---I still don’t know what. The rest of the night passed in a blur and, before I knew it, the morning came. I remember you remarking how tired I looked at breakfast. I can’t remember the exact excuse I gave you now. Something about my bed or my mattress. There, in my new room, I sat by the door and waited. Across the way, I could see the door to the room I’d slept in the night before, where Jessica now stayed. I distinctly remember drumming my fingertips on the desk near the door as I waited. It was only when I resumed my drumming on the desk that I realized something was wrong. I could feel each fingertip hit the wooden desktop, but there was no sound. I looked down at my hand and gave the desk a knock. All that I got was a sore knuckle and absolute silence. There was the figure, and it was moving. Slowly, it glided past my door, its hideous features on full display. Even though the knife was gripped in my hand, I was frozen to the spot. Nothing could have moved me in that moment, and I am so, so sorry for it. I felt a tear run down my cheek as I watched it enter the room where Jessica slept. I stayed there, paralyzed, as minutes passed. I wanted to scream. I wanted to run in there and stab it. But I couldn’t. I just couldn’t. I could never ask you to forgive such cowardice. I don’t know how long it was before I saw the creature again. It floated from the room and back toward the end of the hallway. It wasn’t alone. Jessica followed, slowly but with determined steps. My heart was in my throat. I couldn’t understand what was happening. Even more confusing was the expression I saw on her face, Daniel. It was one of complete and total peace. As I stared into the blackness, I heard a heavy thud from Jessica’s room. Once again, I was off. I got as far as the doorway before I dropped to my knees and released the scream that woke the rest of the household. I am a coward. A selfish, old, miserable coward. I am so, so sorry. It’s been five years since then. The creature came to me again last night. I don’t know why so much time has been allowed to pass between its visits. I heard something once about our lives having a set number of exit points. Perhaps I missed one five years ago, and it’s simply taken me that long to come up on another. This time, I know I won’t be so lucky. I don’t know if this creature comes for us all, Daniel, but I pray you never have to see it for yourself. Goodbye. I love you."}

She felt peace for just a moment before she opened her eyes and felt a sudden, cold knock at the base of her skull. She fell fast, limp and heavy. Knocked out immediately. Wesley emerged timidly from between the trees where no trail was ever paved, entering the park’s garden. He surveyed the area as best he could. He felt confident he was alone and sat down on the bench he usually sat in, cracking open a book with a relieved sigh. Prey Seeks Predation The neurosis of the average prey animal knows little bounds. But in nature, there exists a different breed, a rarer sort that remains blissfully unawa- A firm hand grasped tightly on Wesley’s shoulder. He jolted, letting out a small scream and turned to see an urgent, sallow faced man. “Where’d you-” “Look you’re the only one nearby a-and I think someone really needs help…” Wesley put his book down with some eagerness. “Well, where are they?” he said while standing from his bench. “Just up this hill. Please, hurry!” The man shouted as he moved in a light jog to a tree covered path. Wesley kept up, trying to calm his nerves. “I-I was just walking through here and saw her, she… She... I don’t know how long she’s been laying here but I think it’s anaphylactic shock! Look!” She was so still. She was breathing meekly. Her face was a deep purple and was swollen like a tar bubble just before it popped. A small bag of nuts spilled out of her limp hand. Wesley couldn’t keep his hands from shaking but he tried to stay composed, forcing tears back from falling from his face. “D-di-did s-she h-have an epi-p” “No, I checked for that. Look, she’s not going to be breathing for much longer…” Wesley dropped to his knees right beside her. He scrambled and checked her pulse. “She’s alive!” His voice cracked. “Listen, my friend is a doctor but he’s way out in the parking lot. He’ll know what to do but right now, ” the man hurriedly reached into his jacket and pulled out a pocket knife, “she needs to breathe.” Wesley looked pale. “Someone has to stay here with her…” The man crouched down to meet Wesley's gaze; he was reminded of a shark's eyes. “Just push down, okay? I’m coming back with my doctor friend, but just promise. No matter what. Keep. Pushing. Down.” The man sprung up and dashed to the entrance of the trail before looking back. “And remember! You’re saving her!” The man ran off. Wesley could hardly see through his tears, too frazzled to notice the dark bruise across the whole of the woman’s neck. “I-I-I can… I’ll…” He sniffled and tried his absolute best to force the knife down. “I-I can d-do it… I-I c-can…” He didn’t expect her neck to bleed so much. He almost fainted at the sight of it, but he powered through; he was determined. “I c-can h-help! I can… I-I can do it!”"}
